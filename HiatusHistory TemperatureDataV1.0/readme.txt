** The last observation in each data set is taken to be the date stamp of that data set.

C&W v1 originally released on satellite period only, and ran to the end of 2012. The paper was published late 2013 online. The long v1 version included here was prepared shortly afterwards using the same code, but covers 1850-2013.

Berkeley land-ocean first available in Mar 2014 (running to Dec 2013). The first release and the current are included.

Two HadCRUT v3 versions are included - one from the start of 2010, and the final release to May 2014 (long after HadCRUT v4 had been released). Use the 2014 release for anything past 2010, but truncate at time that V4 came online. 

HadCRUT v4 files are labelled by version number, and in each case represent the final month released with that version number. The exception is HadCRUT4.0.0, which was released in Apr 2012, but only ran to Dec 2010. This was the only version of 4.0 released. We will not use 4.0.0 as it represents just a non-operational single interim release.

The remaining files can be assumed to have been available shortly after the final data on the file. For NASA and NOAA this is incorporated into the filename of the .temp file.

NOAA files, depending on download source, have different baselines. This should not matter as the data will be re-baselined immediately upon reading.
