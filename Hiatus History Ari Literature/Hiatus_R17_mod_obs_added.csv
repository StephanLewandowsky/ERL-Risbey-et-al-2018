According to Global Circulation Models simulations, expected response on the rise of GHGs forcing is tropical temperature altitude amplification - temperature increases faster in higher troposphere than in lower troposphere. In this paper, two satellite data sets, UAH MSU and RSS, were used to test altitude temperature amplification in tropic (20øN-20øS) in the hiatus period. We compared data from satellite data sets from lower troposphere (TLT) and middle troposphere (TMT) in general and particularly for land and ocean (for UAH MSU). The results from both satellite measurements showed the presence of hiatus, i.e. slowdown of the temperature rise in the period 1998-2012 compared to period 1979-2012 (UAH MSU) and temperature fall for RSS data. Smaller increase, i.e. temperature fall over ocean showed that hiatus is an ocean phenomenon above all. Data for UAH MSU showed that temperature altitude amplification in tropic was not present either for period 1979-2012, or 1998-2012. RSS data set also do not show temperature altitude amplification either for longer (1979-2012), or for shorter period (1998-2012). RSS data for successive 15-year periods from 1979-1993 till 1998-2012 does not show tropical temperature altitude amplification and in one case negative trend is registered in TLT and in two cases in TMT. In general, our results do not show presence of temperature altitude amplification in tropic in the hiatus period.","Vladan D. Duci?, Bo?ko M. Milovanovi?, Gorica B. Stanojevi?, Milan ?.

Over the same period, the reconstructed land and sea temperatures of the HADCRUT4, GISS and NCDCdata sets have been warming marginally, mostly because of the largest opportunities to introduce upward biases in a less accurate mixed computational and experimental result. Over the same period of time, the CMIP3 and CMIP5 have predicted huge warmings that have no support in themeasurements or reconstructions.

For its own sake, and to enable better climate prediction for policy use, the reasons behind this mismatch need to be better understood. While an increasing number of possible causes have been proposed, the candidate causes have not yet converged. With this background, this paper reinvestigates the relationship between change in the level of CO2 and two of the major climate variables, atmospheric temperature and the El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Using time-series analysis in the form of dynamic regression modelling with autocorrelation correction, it is shown that first-difference CO2 leads temperature and that there is a highly statistically significant correlation between first-difference CO2 and temperature. Further, a correlation is found for second-difference CO2 with the Southern Oscillation Index, the atmospheric-pressure component of ENSO. This paper also shows that both these correlations display Granger causality. It is shown that the first-difference CO2 and temperature model shows no trend mismatch in recent years. These results may contribute to the prediction of future trends for global temperature and ENSO. Interannual variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 is standardly attributed to variability in the carbon sink capacity of the terrestrial biosphere. The terrestrial biosphere carbon sink is created by the difference between photosynthesis and respiration (net primary productivity): a major way of measuring global terrestrial photosynthesis is by means of satellite measurements of vegetation reflectance, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In a preliminary analysis, this study finds a close correlation between an increasing NDVI and the increasing climate model/temperature mismatch (as quantified by the difference between the trend in the level of CO2 and the trend in temperature).","L.

Reconstructions (modelling results based on selected scattered measurements) and simulations (modelling results not based on observations) have both shown a significant warming since the year 1970 that increased at an ever faster rate over the 14 years this century. It is shown here that, contrary to this claim, the detailed measurements of the ocean temperature and salinity by the sampling buoys of the ARGO project show only minor changes of temperature and salinity since the early 2000s. The ARGO results cover the ocean layers 0?2000 m except for the North and South Poles. The satellite NSSTC surface air temperature measurements over the world oceans show a global cooling over the last 11 years, and the satellite NSDIC sea ice extent measurements show globally increasing ice coverage over the North and South Poles. The North Pole sea ice is certainly reducing, but over the last 11 years the growth of the South Pole sea ice has more than compensated that loss.

However, these same climate models predicted a warming also from 2000 to 2014, which has not been seen in the global surface temperature. Researchers have proposed several solutions such as the fact that the ?missing heat? was accumulated in the deep ocean. However, no evidences of a sufficient warming of the deep oceans have been observed. Other arguments has been proposed as well and found unsatisfactory. There is the opportunity that the ?heat? is not ?real? but ?missing? or ?hiding? somewhere. If the climate model projected ?heat? that simply does not exist in reality in the first place, consequently the models overestimate the anthropogenicwarming and also the sea level projections for the 21st century are overestimated.",Albert Parker,2014,Nonlinear Engineering,3,4,247-253,13-03-14,08-08-14,10.1515/nleng-2014-0011,http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/nleng.ahead-of-print/nleng-2014-0011/nleng-2014-0011.xml,,1,,,En
219,,9b,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Why global warming went missing since the year 2000,"Over the period January 2004 to present, the seas have experienced the lack of any warming, as finally properly measured in the ARGO project where a global array of more than 3,600 free-drifting profiling floats has measured the temperature of the upper 2000 m of the sea as it was not possible before. The warming of the seas has been a negligible 1.1*10-3 øC/year on average over the layer 0 ? 2000 dbar below the accuracy of the measure. Over the period January 2000 to present, the measured land and sea temperatures of the less reliable GISS, NCDC and HADCRUT4 data sets have shown a small warming of 4.2*10-3 øC/year on average. Same period, the climate models propose for the land and sea temperatures an unrealistic warming of 20.5*10-3 øC/year (average of CMIP3) and 18.2*10-3 øC/year (average of the CMIP5). The ?inconvenient truth? is that climate models are predicting a warming when there is no warming rather than simply overestimating the warming as discussed so far. The paper presents the failed validation of the climate models since their introduction and suggests the reasons of their failure in the overrated effect of the changed composition of the atmosphere and the neglected natural oscillations.",Albert Parker,2013,Nonlinear Engineering,2,3-4,129-135,,31-10-13,10.1515/nleng-2013-0017,http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/nleng.2013.2.issue-3-4/nleng-2013-0017/nleng-2013-0017.xml,,1,,,En

Climate model experiments1, 2, 3, 4 show that this slowdown was largely driven by a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with a smaller external contribution from solar variability, and volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols5, 6. The prevailing view is that this negative PDO occurred through internal variability7, 8, 9, 10, 11. However, here we show that coupled models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project robustly simulate a negative PDO in response to anthropogenic aerosols implying a potentially important role for external human influences. The recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 also contributed to the slowdown in GMST trends. Our results suggest that a slowdown in GMST trends could have been predicted in advance, and that future reduction of anthropogenic aerosol emissions, particularly from China, would promote a positive PDO and increased GMST trends over the coming years. Furthermore, the overestimation of the magnitude of recent warming by models is substantially reduced by using detection and attribution analysis to rescale their response to external factors, especially cooling following volcanic eruptions. Improved understanding of external influences on climate is therefore crucial to constrain near-term climate predictions.","Doug M. Smith, Ben B. B. Booth, Nick J.

Possible explanations for the slow-down include internal climate variability, external cooling influences and observational errors. Several recent modelling studies have examined the contribution of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions to the muted surface warming. Here we present a detailed analysis of the impact of recent volcanic forcing on tropospheric temperature, based on observations as well as climate model simulations. We identify statistically significant correlations between observations of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and satellite-based estimates of both tropospheric temperature and short-wave fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. We show that climate model simulations without the effects of early twenty-first-century volcanic eruptions overestimate the tropospheric warming observed since 1998. In two simulations with more realistic volcanic influences following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends over the period 1998 to 2012 are up to 15% smaller, with large uncertainties in the magnitude of the effect. To reduce these uncertainties, better observations of eruption-specific properties of volcanic aerosols are needed, as well as improved representation of these eruption-specific properties in climate model simulations.","Benjamin D.

To explain such a pause, an increase in ocean heat uptake below the superficial ocean layer has been proposed to overcompensate for the Earth?s heat storage. Contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum, the stratospheric water vapour, the stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols. However, a robust attribution of this warming slowdown has not been achievable up to now. Here we show successful retrospective predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead, the analysis of which allows us to attribute the onset of this slowdown to an increase in ocean heat uptake. Sensitivity experiments accounting only for the external radiative forcings do not reproduce the slowdown. The top-of-atmosphere net energy input remained in the [0.5?1]?W?m?2 interval during the past decade, which is successfully captured by our predictions. Most of this excess energy was absorbed in the top 700?m of the ocean at the onset of the warming pause, 65% of it in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown. The ability to predict retrospectively this slowdown not only strengthens our confidence in the robustness of our climate models, but also enhances the socio-economic relevance of operational decadal climate predictions.","Virginie Guemas, Francisco J.

A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades?unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models?is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1?0.2 øC, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate.","Matthew H.

Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming, but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 8.2% of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970?2012 (which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming). Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA. Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La-Ni¤a-like decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase.","Yu Kosaka, Shang-Ping Xie",2013,Nature,501,7467,403-407,18-06-13,28-08-13,10.1038/nature12534,http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7467/abs/nature12534.html,,1,,,En

It has been noted that this warming hiatus is accompanied by a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which represents low-frequency variability over the Pacific. On the other hand, the 2015/2016 El Ni¤o is among the strongest comparable to the 1997/1998 event, which coincides with the recently altered PDO phase from negative to positive. These observational evidences have generated substantial interest in the role of low-frequency variations in modulating El Ni¤o-Southern Oscillation amplitude as well as manifestation of warming signal in the tropical Pacific. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately separate low-frequency variability and global warming signal from SST records. Here, we present three primary modes of global SST that include secular warming trend, low-frequency variability, and biennial oscillation. Based on the independent behavior of these three modes, global warming is clearly continuing but its manifestation is enhanced (depressed) when the low-frequency variation is in the positive (negative) phase. Further, possibility of strong El Ni¤o increases under the positive phase of the low-frequency mode, which amplifies warming over the tropical eastern Pacific. Indeed, the strong 2015/2016 El Ni¤o is largely attributed to the positive phase of the low-frequency mode. In order to examine the climate models? ability to simulate the three SST modes as obtained in the observational record, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) datasets are also analyzed. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the three modes have been replicated closely by the selected CMIP5 models forced by the historical condition, which provides an analogy of the interplay of three modes in the observed tropical Pacific SST.","Sae-Rim Yeo, Sang-Wook Yeh, Kwang-Yul Kim, WonMoo Kim",2016,Climate Dynamics,,,,29-05-16,05-10-16,10.1007/s00382-016-3376-0,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3376-0,,1,,,En

The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific, intensifying trade winds, changes in El Ni¤o activity, increasing volcanic activity and decreasing solar irradiance. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the difference between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called ?hiatus? period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns different from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades.","Aiguo Dai, John C.

This phenomenon is often called hiatus or warming pause, which is challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes warming environment. Our study characterized the hiatus by analyzing the HadGEM2-AO (95 yrs) simulation data based on RCP8.5 scenario. The PC2 time series from the EOF of the zonal mean vertical ocean temperature has been defined as the index that represents the warming pause. The relationship between the hiatus, ENSO and the changes in climate system are identified by utilizing the newly defined PC2. Since the La Nina index (defined as the negative of NINO3 index) leads PC2 by about 11 months, it may be possible that the La Nina causes the warming to be interrupted. We also show that the cooling of the climate system closed tied to the heat penetration into the deep ocean, indicating the weakening the warming rate is due to the oceanic heat uptake.

However, the observed energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1?W?m?2 (refs 2, 3) should be producing warming somewhere in the system. Here we analyse twenty-first-century climate-model simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1?W?m?2 as observed for the past decade. Eight decades with a slightly negative global mean surface-temperature trend show that the ocean above 300?m takes up significantly less heat whereas the ocean below 300?m takes up significantly more, compared with non-hiatus decades. The model provides a plausible depiction of processes in the climate system causing the hiatus periods, and indicates that a hiatus period is a relatively common climate phenomenon and may be linked to La Ni¤a-like conditions.","Gerald A.

This apparent contradiction has been reconciled by an anomalous heat flux into the ocean, induced by a shift towards a La Ni¤a-like state with cold sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific over the past decade or so. A significant portion of the heat missing from the atmosphere is therefore expected to be stored in the Pacific Ocean. However, in situ hydrographic records indicate that Pacific Ocean heat content has been decreasing9. Here, we analyse observations along with simulations from a global ocean?sea ice model to track the pathway of heat. We find that the enhanced heat uptake by the Pacific Ocean has been compensated by an increased heat transport from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, carried by the Indonesian throughflow. As a result, Indian Ocean heat content has increased abruptly, which accounts for more than 70% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper 700 m during the past decade. We conclude that the Indian Ocean has become increasingly important in modulating global climate variability.","Sang-Ki Lee, Wonsun Park, Molly O. Baringer, Arnold L.

However, closure depends on invoking an unrealistically large increase in aerosol cooling2 during the so-called global warming hiatus since the late 1990s (refs 3,4) that was due partly to tropical Pacific Ocean cooling5, 6, 7. The difficulty with this closure lies in the assumption that the same climate feedback applies to both anthropogenic warming and natural cooling. Here we analyse climate model simulations with and without anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, and show that top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature are much less tightly coupled for natural decadal variability than for the greenhouse-gas-induced response, implying distinct climate feedback between anthropogenic warming and natural variability. In addition, we identify a phase difference between top-of-the-atmosphere radiation and global mean surface temperature such that ocean heat uptake tends to slow down during the surface warming hiatus. This result deviates from existing energy theory but we find that it is broadly consistent with observations. Our study highlights the importance of developing metrics that distinguish anthropogenic change from natural variations to attribute climate variability and to estimate climate sensitivity from observations.","Shang-Ping Xie, Yu Kosaka, Yuko M.

However, little has been said in this discussion about observed and simulated trends in global temperature extremes. Here we assess trend patterns in temperature extremes and evaluate the consistency between observed and simulated temperature extremes over the past four decades (1971?2010) in comparison to the recent 15 years (1996?2010). We consider the coldest night and warmest day in a year in the observational dataset HadEX2 and in the current generation of global climate models (CMIP5). In general, the observed trends fall within the simulated range of trends, with better consistency for the longer period. Spatial trend patterns differ for the warm and cold extremes, with the warm extremes showing continuous positive trends across the globe and the cold extremes exhibiting a coherent cooling pattern across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes that has emerged in the recent 15 years and is not reproduced by the models. This regional inconsistency between models and observations might be a key to understanding the recent hiatus in global mean temperature warming.","Jana Sillmann, Markus G. Donat, John C.

Natural variability, a reduced radiative forcing, a smaller warming response to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and coverage bias in the observations have been identified as potential causes. However, the explanations of the so-called ?warming hiatus? remain fragmented and the implications for long-term temperature projections are unclear. Here we estimate the contribution of internal variability associated with the El Ni¤o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using segments of unforced climate model control simulations that match the observed climate variability. We find that ENSO variability analogous to that between 1997 or 1998 and 2012 leads to a cooling trend of about ?0.06 øC. In addition, updated solar and stratospheric aerosol forcings from observations explain a cooling trend of similar magnitude (?0.07 øC). Accounting for these adjusted trends we show that a climate model of reduced complexity with a transient climate response of about 1.8 øC is consistent with the temperature record of the past 15 years, as is the ensemble mean of the models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).

One of the principal issues is the cause of the hiatus in the current global warming trend. There appears to be a widely held view that climatic change warming should exhibit an inexorable upwards trend, a view that implies there is no longer any input by climatic variability in the existing climatic system. The relative roles of climatic change and climatic variability are examined here using the same coupled global climatic model. For the former, the model is run using a specified CO2 growth scenario, while the latter consisted of a multi-millennial simulation where any climatic variability was attributable solely to internal processes within the climatic system. It is shown that internal climatic variability can produce global mean surface temperature anomalies of ñ0.25 K and sustained positive and negative anomalies sufficient to account for the anomalous warming of the 1940s as well as the present hiatus in the observed global warming. The characteristics of the internally-induced negative temperature anomalies are such that if this internal natural variability is the cause of the observed hiatus, then a resumption of the observed global warming trend is to be expected within the next few years.",B.

Some studies and the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report suggest that the recent 15-year period (1998?2012) provides evidence that models are overestimating current temperature evolution. Such comparisons are not evidence against model trends because they represent only one realization where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations. We present a more appropriate test of models where only those models with natural variability (represented by El Ni¤o/Southern Oscillation) largely in phase with observations are selected from multi-model ensembles for comparison with observations.

The hypothesis that the industrial epoch warming was a giant natural fluctuation was rejected with 99.9% confidence. In this paper, this method is extended to the determination of event return times. Over the period 1880?2013, the largest 32?year event is expected to be 0.47?K, effectively explaining the postwar cooling (amplitude 0.42?0.47?K). Similarly, the ?pause? since 1998 (0.28?0.37?K) has a return period of 20?50?years (not so unusual).

If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models.

Recent climate model simulations indicate this warming hiatus originated from eastern equatorial Pacific cooling associated with strengthening of trade winds. Using a climate model that overrides tropical wind stress anomalies with observations for 1958?2012, we show that decadal-mean anomalies of global SAT referenced to the period 1961?1990 are changed by 0.11, 0.13 and ?0.11 øC in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, without variation in human-induced radiative forcing. They account for about 47%, 38% and 27% of the respective temperature change. The dominant wind stress variability consistent with this warming/cooling represents the deceleration/acceleration of the Pacific trade winds, which can be robustly reproduced by atmospheric model simulations forced by observed sea surface temperature excluding anthropogenic warming components. Results indicate that inherent decadal climate variability contributes considerably to the observed global-mean SAT time series, but that its influence on decadal-mean SAT has gradually decreased relative to the rising anthropogenic warming signal.","Masahiro Watanabe, Hideo Shiogama, Hiroaki Tatebe, Michiya Hayashi, Masayoshi Ishii, Masahide Kimoto",2014,NCC,4,October 2014,893-897,23-05-14,31-08-14,10.1038/nclimate2355,http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n10/full/nclimate2355.html,,1,,,En

A previous study showed that the net energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere of about 1 W m?2 is associated with greater increases of deep ocean heat content below 750 m during the hiatus decades, while there is little globally averaged surface temperature increase or warming in the upper ocean layers. Here the authors examine processes involved with accelerated warming decades and address the relative roles of external forcing from increasing greenhouse gases and internally generated decadal climate variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). Model results from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), show that accelerated warming decades are characterized by rapid warming of globally averaged surface air temperature, greater increases of heat content in the upper ocean layers, and less heat content increase in the deep ocean, opposite to the hiatus decades. In addition to contributions from processes potentially linked to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the positive phase of the IPO, adding to the response to external forcing, is usually associated with accelerated warming decades. Conversely, hiatus decades typically occur with the negative phase of the IPO, when warming from the external forcing is overwhelmed by internally generated cooling in the tropical Pacific. Internally generated hiatus periods of up to 15 years with zero global warming trend are present in the future climate simulations. This suggests that there is a chance that the current observed hiatus could extend for several more years.","Gerald A. Meehl, Aixue Hu, Julie M. Arblaster, John Fasullo, Kevin E.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that large trends (~0.3 K dec?1) in GST can arise from internal climate variability and that these trends are generally an unreliable indicator of TOA over the same period. In contrast, trends in total OHC explain 95% or more of the variance in TOA for two-thirds of the models analysed; emphasizing the oceans' role as Earth's primary energy store. Correlation of trends in total system energy (TE ð time integrated TOA) against trends in OHC suggests that for most models the ocean becomes the dominant term in the planetary energy budget on a timescale of about 12 months. In the context of the recent pause in global surface temperature rise, we investigate the potential importance of internal climate variability in both TOA and ocean heat rearrangement.

Certain climate models, operating under experiments which simulate warming by increasing radiative forcing, have been shown to reproduce periods which resemble the observed hiatus. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of 38 CMIP5 climate models to provide further evidence that models produce warming hiatus periods during warming experiments. GST rates are simulated in each model for the 21st century using two experiments: a moderate warming scenario (RCP4.5) and high-end scenario (RCP8.5). Warming hiatus periods are identified in model simulations by detecting (1) ò15-year periods lacking a statistically meaningful trend and (2) rapid changes in the GST rate which resemble the observed 1998?2012 hiatus. Under the RCP4.5 experiment, all tested models produce warming hiatus periods. However, once radiative forcing exceeds 5?W/m2?about 2øC GST increase?as simulated in the RCP8.5 experiment after 2050, nearly all models produce only positive warming trends.

Here we analyse simulations and observations of GMST from 1900 to 2012, and show that the distribution of simulated 15-year trends shows no systematic bias against the observations. Using a multiple regression approach that is physically motivated by surface energy balance, we isolate the impact of radiative forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST?with the regression residual interpreted as internal variability?and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and observations. The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.","Jochem Marotzke, Piers M.

For a given global warming signal produced by a climate model ensemble, there exists an envelope of GMT values representing the range of possible unforced states of the climate system (the Envelope of Unforced Noise; EUN). Typically, the EUN is derived from climate models themselves, but climate models might not accurately simulate the correct characteristics of unforced GMT variability. Here, we simulate a new, empirical, EUN that is based on instrumental and reconstructed surface temperature records. We compare the forced GMT signal produced by climate models to observations while noting the range of GMT values provided by the empirical EUN. We find that the empirical EUN is wide enough so that the interdecadal variability in the rate of global warming over the 20th century does not necessarily require corresponding variability in the rate-of-increase of the forced signal. The empirical EUN also indicates that the reduced GMT warming over the past decade or so is still consistent with a middle emission scenario?s forced signal, but is likely inconsistent with the steepest emission scenario?s forced signal.","Patrick T.

From 1992 to 2013, to first order, the observed SWV exhibited three distinct piece-wise trends: a steady increase from 1992 to 2000, an abrupt drop from 2000 to 2004, and a gradual recovery after 2004, while the global-mean surface temperature experienced a strong increase until 2000 and a warming hiatus after 2000. The atmosphere-only CESM shows that the seasonal variation of tropical-mean (30øS?30øN) SWV is anticorrelated with that of the tropical-mean sea surface temperature (SST), while the correlation between the tropical SWV and SST anomalies on the interannual time scale is rather weak. By nudging the modeled SWV to prescribed profiles in coupled atmosphere-slab ocean experiments, we investigate the impact of SWV variations on surface temperature change. We find that a uniform 1 ppmv (0.5 ppmv) SWV increase (decrease) leads to an equilibrium global mean surface warming (cooling) of 0.12 ñ 0.05 øC (?0.07 ñ 0.05 øC). Sensitivity experiments show that the equilibrium response of global mean surface temperature to SWV perturbations over the extratropics is larger than that over the tropics. The observed sudden drop of SWV from 2000 to 2004 produces a global mean surface cooling of about ?0.048 ñ 0.041 øC, which suggests that a persistent change in SWV would make an imprint on long-term variations of global-mean surface temperature. A constant linear increase in SWV based on the satellite-observed rate of SWV change yields a global mean surface warming of 0.03 ñ 0.01 øC/decade over a 50-year period, which accounts for about 19 % of the observed surface temperature increase prior to the warming hiatus. In the same experiment, trend analyses during different periods reveal a multi-year adjustment of surface temperature before the response to SWV forcing becomes strong relative to the internal variability in the model.","Yuan Wang, Hui Su, Jonathan H.

In this sequence tropical west Pacific wind stress signals lead equatorial east Pacific thermocline depth signals which lead tropical east Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) signals which lead GMST signals. Using the anthropogenic, natural and tropical wind signals extracted from our simulations in a multivariate linear regression with observed GMST makes clear the balance that exists between anthropogenic warming and tropical wind-induced cooling during the recent warming slowdown, and between volcanic cooling and tropical wind-induced warming during the El Chich¢n and Pinatubo eruptions. Finally, we find an anticorrelation between global-mean temperatures in the near-surface (upper ? 100 m) and subsurface (? 100?300 m) ocean layers, linked to wind-driven interannual to decadal variations in the strength of the subtropical cell overturning in the upper Pacific Ocean.","Oleg A.

66,Delworth et al. 2015,3,2002,3,2013,,,,,,1,,,2,A Link between the Hiatus in Global Warming and North American Drought,"Portions of western North America have experienced prolonged drought over the last decade. This drought has occurred at the same time as the global warming hiatus?a decadal period with little increase in global mean surface temperature. Climate models and observational analyses are used to clarify the dual role of recent tropical Pacific changes in driving both the global warming hiatus and North American drought. When observed tropical Pacific wind stress anomalies are inserted into coupled models, the simulations produce persistent negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific, a hiatus in global warming, and drought over North America driven by SST-induced atmospheric circulation anomalies. In the simulations herein the tropical wind anomalies account for 92% of the simulated North American drought during the recent decade, with 8% from anthropogenic radiative forcing changes. This suggests that anthropogenic radiative forcing is not the dominant driver of the current drought, unless the wind changes themselves are driven by anthropogenic radiative forcing. The anomalous tropical winds could also originate from coupled interactions in the tropical Pacific or from forcing outside the tropical Pacific. The model experiments suggest that if the tropical winds were to return to climatological conditions, then the recent tendency toward North American drought would diminish. Alternatively, if the anomalous tropical winds were to persist, then the impact on North American drought would continue; however, the impact of the enhanced Pacific easterlies on global temperature diminishes after a decade or two due to a surface reemergence of warmer water that was initially subducted into the ocean interior.","Thomas L.

68,Power et al. 2016,3,1997,3,2014,,,,,,1,,,2,Apparent limitations in the ability of CMIP5 climate models to simulate recent multi-decadal change in surface temperature: implications for global temperature projections,"Observed surface temperature trends over the period 1998?2012/2014 have attracted a great deal of interest because of an apparent slowdown in the rate of global warming, and contrasts between climate model simulations and observations of such trends. Many studies have addressed the statistical significance of these relatively short-trends, whether they indicate a possible bias in the model values and the implications for global warming generally. Here we re-examine these issues, but as they relate to changes over much longer-term changes. We find that on multi-decadal time scales there is little evidence for any change in the observed global warming rate, but some evidence for a recent temporary slowdown in the warming rate in the Pacific. This multi-decadal slowdown can be partly explained by a cool phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and a short-term excess of La Ni¤a events. We also analyse historical and projected changes in 38 CMIP climate models. All of the model simulations examined simulate multi-decadal warming in the Pacific over the past half-century that exceeds observed values. This difference cannot be fully explained by observed internal multi-decadal climate variability, even if allowance is made for an apparent tendency for models to underestimate internal multi-decadal variability in the Pacific. Models which simulate the greatest global warming over the past half-century also project warming that is among the highest of all models by the end of the twenty-first century, under both low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Given that the same models are poorest in representing observed multi-decadal temperature change, confidence in the highest projections is reduced.","Scott Power, Fran‡ois Delage, Guomin Wang, Ian Smith, Greg Kociuba",2016,Climate Dynamics,,,,22-12-15,28-09-16,10.1007/s00382-016-3326-x,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3326-x,1,1,,,En

We computed trends by using a nonparametric method and considering long-term persistence in the time series. The role of internal variability is examined by using large ensemble climate simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research model Community Earth System Model (CESM). We computed temperature trends for three periods: (1) the twentieth century, (2) the second half of the twentieth century, and (3) the recent hiatus period to contrast the roles of external forcing and internal variability at various spatial and temporal scales. Both CMIP ensembles show statistically significant warming at global and continental scales during the twentieth century. We found a small but statistically significant difference between CMIP3 (0.57?ñ?0.07?øC/century) and CMIP5 (0.47?ñ?0.06?øC/century) twentieth century temperature trends, with the CMIP3 estimate being closer to the observations. The spatial structure of long-term temperature trends, and top-of-the atmosphere net radiation trends, suggests that differences in model parameterizations and feedback processes that lead to a smaller net radiative forcing are likely contributing to the differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5. The estimate of internal variability based on the CESM large ensemble spans 24% of the uncertainty in CMIP5 for the twentieth century temperature trends, and 76% for the recent hiatus period, both at global scales, and 43% and almost 100% during the corresponding time periods at regional scales.","Sanjiv Kumar, James L.

Recent numerical studies have, however, tempered the relevance of the observed pause in global warming by highlighting the key role of tropical Pacific internal variability. Here we first show that many climate models overestimate the influence of the El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation on GMST, thereby shedding doubt on their ability to capture the tropical Pacific contribution to the hiatus. Moreover, we highlight that model results can be quite sensitive to the experimental design. We argue that overriding the surface wind stress is more suitable than nudging the sea surface temperature for controlling the tropical Pacific ocean heat uptake and, thereby, the multidecadal variability of GMST. Using the former technique, our model captures several aspects of the recent climate evolution, including the weaker slowdown of global warming over land and the transition toward a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Yet the observed global warming is still overestimated not only over the recent 1998?2012 hiatus period but also over former decades, thereby suggesting that the model might be too sensitive to the prescribed radiative forcings.","H.

Here, we derive samples of all natural and internal variability from observations and a recent proxy reconstruction to investigate the likelihood that these two sources of variability could produce a hiatus or rapid warming in surface temperature. The likelihood is found to be consistent with that calculated previously for models and exhibits a similar spatial pattern, with an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation-like structure, although with more signal in the Atlantic than in model patterns. The number and length of events increases if natural forcing is also considered, particularly in the models. From the reconstruction it can be seen that large eruptions, such as Mount Tambora in 1815, or clusters of eruptions, may result in a hiatus of over 20 years, a finding supported by model results.","Andrew P.

By using an oceanic general circulation model, the authors focus on the contributions from two types of forcing: wind stress and thermohaline forcing. The simulated results show that the heat sink in the upper Southern Ocean comes mainly from thermohaline forcing; while in the deeper layers, wind stress forcing also plays an important role. These different contributions may be due to different physical processes for the heat budget. The combination of these two types of forcing shows a significant heat sink in the Southern Ocean in the recent hiatus decade, and this is consistent with the observations and conclusions of a similar recently published study.","OU Nian-Sen, LIN Yi-Hua, BI Xun-Qiang",2015,Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters,8,3,174-178,10-01-15,16-02-15,10.3878/AOSL20150008,http://www.iapjournals.ac.cn/aosl/EN/abstract/abstract552.shtml,,1,,,En

The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation9, 10 has been implicated in modulations of global mean surface temperatures6, 11, but which part of the mode drives the variability in warming rates is unclear. Here we present a successful simulation of the global warming staircase since 1900 with a global ocean?atmosphere coupled model where tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are forced to follow the observed evolution. Without prescribed tropical Pacific variability, the same model, on average, produces a continual warming trend that accelerates after the 1960s. We identify four events where the tropical Pacific decadal cooling markedly slowed down the warming trend. Matching the observed spatial and seasonal fingerprints we identify the tropical Pacific as a key pacemaker of the warming staircase, with radiative forcing driving the overall warming trend. Specifically, tropical Pacific variability amplifies the first warming epoch of the 1910s?1940s and determines the timing when the big hiatus starts and ends. Our method of removing internal variability from the observed record can be used for real-time monitoring of anthropogenic warming.","Yu Kosaka, Shang-Ping Xie",2016,Nature geoscience,9,9,669-673,16-03-16,18-07-16,10.1038/ngeo2770,http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n9/abs/ngeo2770.html,,1,,,En

Part II: climate variability,"This study forms part II of two papers describing ECHAM6-FESOM, a newly established global climate model with a unique multi-resolution sea ice-ocean component. While part I deals with the model description and the mean climate state, here we examine the internal climate variability of the model under constant present-day (1990) conditions. We (1) assess the internal variations in the model in terms of objective variability performance indices, (2) analyze variations in global mean surface temperature and put them in context to variations in the observed record, with particular emphasis on the recent warming slowdown, (3) analyze and validate the most common atmospheric and oceanic variability patterns, (4) diagnose the potential predictability of various climate indices, and (5) put the multi-resolution approach to the test by comparing two setups that differ only in oceanic resolution in the equatorial belt, where one ocean mesh keeps the coarse ~1ø resolution applied in the adjacent open-ocean regions and the other mesh is gradually refined to ~0.25ø. Objective variability performance indices show that, in the considered setups, ECHAM6-FESOM performs overall favourably compared to five well-established climate models. Internal variations of the global mean surface temperature in the model are consistent with observed fluctuations and suggest that the recent warming slowdown can be explained as a once-in-one-hundred-years event caused by internal climate variability; periods of strong cooling in the model (?hiatus? analogs) are mainly associated with ENSO-related variability and to a lesser degree also to PDO shifts, with the AMO playing a minor role. Common atmospheric and oceanic variability patterns are simulated largely consistent with their real counterparts. Typical deficits also found in other models at similar resolutions remain, in particular too weak non-seasonal variability of SSTs over large parts of the ocean and episodic periods of almost absent deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea, resulting in overestimated North Atlantic SST variability. Concerning the influence of locally (isotropically) increased resolution, the ENSO pattern and index statistics improve significantly with higher resolution around the equator, illustrating the potential of the novel unstructured-mesh method for global climate modeling.","T.

However, the relationship between SST in these two basins underwent a dramatic transformation beginning around 1985. Prior to that, SST variations associated with the Indian Ocean Basin Mode (IOB) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) were positively correlated, while afterwards they were much less clearly synchronized. We present evidence from both observations and coupled state-of-the-art climate models that enhanced external forcing, particularly increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases, was the principal cause of this changed relationship. Using coupled climate model experiments, we determine that without external forcing, the evolution of the IOB would be strongly forced by variations in the IPO. However, with strong external forcing, the dynamical linkage between the IOB and the IPO weakens and so that the negative phase IPO after 2000 is unable to force a negative phase IOB cooling of the Indian Ocean. This changed relationship in the IOB and IPO led to unique SST patterns in the Indo-Pacific region after 2000, which favored exceptionally strong easterly trade winds over the tropical Pacific Ocean and a pronounced global warming hiatus in the first decade of the 21st century.","Lu Dong, Michael J.

It shows good skill in decadal hindcasts with the recent warming slowdown well captured. While our ensemble mean temperature projections at the end of 21st century are consistent with those from ESMs, our decadal warming projection of 0.35 (0.30-0.43)?K from 1986?2005 to 2016?2035 is within their projection range and only two-thirds of the ensemble mean from ESMs. Our predicted warming rate in the next few years is slower than in the 1980s and 1990s, followed by a greater warming rate.

The hypothesis is that aerosol forcing and in particular, the impact of indirect effects of aerosols on clouds (Aerosol?Cloud Interactions, or ACI), explains the recent ?hiatus? in global mean surface temperature increases. Sulfate aerosol emissions increase globally from 2000 to 2005, and then decrease slightly to 2010. Thus the change in anthropogenic sulfate induced net global radiative forcing is small over the period. Regionally, there are statistically significant forcings that are similar in both models, and consistent with changes in simulated emissions and aerosol optical depth. Coupled model simulations are performed to look at impacts of the forcing on recent surface temperatures. Temperature response patterns in the models are similar, and reflect the regional radiative forcing. Pattern correlations indicate significant correlations between observed decadal surface temperature changes and simulated surface temperature changes from recent sulfate aerosol forcing in an equilibrium framework.

Construction of two 30-member Earth System Model ensembles,"The recent IPCC report along with numerous studies since, have suggested that the apparent global warming hiatus results from some combination of natural variability and changes to external forcings. Herein the external forcings for GHGs, long-lived trace gases, volcanic and tropospheric aerosols, and solar irradiance have been replaced in the Norwegian Earth System Model using recent observational estimates. The potential impact of these alternative forcings, and by residual the internally generated variability, is examined through two 30-member ensembles covering the period 1980 to 2012. The Reference ensemble uses the CMIP5 historical forcings extended with the RCP8.5 scenario, while the Sensitivity ensemble uses the alternative forcings. Over the hiatus period defined herein as 1998?2012, all of the forcings show some change between the Sensitivity and Reference experiments and have a combined net forcing change of ?0.03Wm?2. The GHG forcing is 0.012Wm?2 higher in the Sensitivity forcings. The alternative solar forcing differs from the Reference forcing by ?0.08Wm?2, the same as the alternative volcanic forcing that was based on the latest estimates from NASA-GISS. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions were replaced using the EU-EclipseV4a dataset and produce a mean forcing change of 0.11Wm?2 over the period.

The ensembles? surface temperature trends are statistically indistinguishable over 1998-2012 despite differences in the prescribed forcings. There is thus no evidence that forcing errors play a significant role in explaining the hiatus according to NorESM. The observations fall either towards the lower portion of the ensembles or, for some observational estimates and regions, outside. The exception is the Arctic where the observations fall towards the upper ensemble bounds. Observational dataset choices can make a large difference to findings of consistency or otherwise. Those NorESM ensemble members that exhibit nino3.4 SST trends similar to observed also exhibit comparable tropical and to some extent global-mean trends, supporting a role for ENSO in explaining the hiatus. Several ensemble members capture the marked seasonality observed in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude trends, with cooling in the wintertime and warming in the remaining seasons. Overall, we find that we cannot falsify NorESM as being capable of explaining the observed hiatus behavior.

However, these models significantly overestimated global mean surface temperature (GMST) during 2006?2014. Based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, the long term change of the observed GMST time series of HadCRUT4 records during 1850?2014 was analyzed, then the simulated GMST by 33 CMIP5 climate models was assessed. The possible reason that climate models failed to project the recent global warming hiatus was revealed. Results show that during 1850?2014 the GMST on a centennial timescale rose with fluctuation, dominated by the secular trend and the multi-decadal variability (MDV). The secular trend was relatively steady beginning in the early 20th century, with an average warming rate of 0.0883øC/decade over the last 50 years. While the MDV (with a ~65-year cycle) showed 2.5 multi-decadal waves during 1850?2014, which deepened and steepened with time, the alarming warming over the last quarter of the 20th century was a result of the concurrence of the secular warming trend and the warming phase of the MDV, both of which accounted one third of the temperature increase during 1975?1998. Recently the slowdown of global warming emerged as the MDV approached its third peak, leading to a reduction in the warming rate. A comparative analysis between the GMST time series derived from HadCRUT4 records and 33 CMIP5 model outputs reveals that the GMSTs during the historical simulation period of 1850?2005 can be reproduced well by models, especially on the accelerated global warming over the last quarter of 20th century. However, the projected GMSTs and their linear trends during 2006?2014 under the RCP4.5 scenario were significantly higher than observed. This is because the CMIP5 models confused the MDV with secular trend underlying the GMST time series, which results in a fast secular trend and an improper MDV with irregular phases and small amplitudes. This implies that the role of atmospheric CO2 in global warming may be overestimated, while the MDV which is an interior oscillation of the climate system may be underestimated, which should be related to insufficient understanding of key climatic internal dynamic processes. Our study puts forward an important criterion for the new generation of climate models: they should be able to simulate both the secular trend and the MDV of GMST.","Meng Wei, FangLi Qiao",2016,Science China Earth Sciences,60,2,397-408,12-05-16,19-10-16,10.1007/s11430-015-5465-y,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11430-015-5465-y,,1,,,En

The common accepted picture is that since the late 1990s, the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcings has been counterbalanced by other factors, e.g., a decrease in natural forcings, augmented ocean heat storage and negative phases of ocean?atmosphere-coupled oscillation patterns. Here, simple vector autoregressive models are used for forecasting the temperature hiatus in the period 2001?2014. This gives new insight into the problem of understanding the ocean contribution (in terms of heat uptake and atmosphere?ocean-coupled oscillations) to the appearance of this recent hiatus. In particular, considering data about the ocean heat content until a depth of 700 m and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation is necessary for correctly forecasting the hiatus, so catching both trend and interannual variability. Our models also show that the ocean heat uptake is substantially driven by the natural component of the total radiative forcing at a decadal time scale, confining the importance of the anthropogenic influences to a longer range warming of the ocean.","Antonello Pasini, Umberto Triacca, Alessandro Attanasio",2016,Theoretical and Applied Climatology,,,,06-10-15,04-05-16,10.1007/s00704-016-1818-6,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-016-1818-6,,1,,,En

Heat content changes in the ocean, including hiatus of global surface temperature and other phenomena, can be interpreted in terms of heaving associated with adjustment of wind-driven circulation induced by decadal variability of wind. A simple reduced gravity model is used to examine the consequence of adiabatic adjustment of the wind-driven circulation. Decadal changes in wind stress forcing can induce three-dimensional redistribution of warm water in the upper ocean. In particular, wind stress change can generate baroclinic modes of heat content anomaly in the vertical direction; in fact, changes in stratification observed in the ocean may be induced by wind stress change at local or in the remote parts of the world oceans. Intensification of the equatorial easterly can induce cooling in the upper layer and warming in the subsurface layer. The combination of this kind of heat content anomaly with the general trend of warming of the whole water column under the increasing greenhouse effect may offer an explanation for the hiatus of global surface temperature and the accelerating subsurface warming over the past 10?15 years. Furthermore, the meridional transport of warm water in the upper ocean can lead to sizeable transient meridional overturning circulation, poleward heat flux and vertical heat flux.

Cloud feedbacks, in turn, depend on the spatial patterns of surface warming4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which vary on decadal timescales. Therefore, the magnitude of the decadal cloud feedback could deviate from the long-term cloud feedback4. Here we present climate model simulations to show that the global mean cloud feedback in response to decadal temperature fluctuations varies dramatically due to time variations in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature. We find that cloud anomalies associated with these patterns significantly modify the Earth?s energy budget. Specifically, the decadal cloud feedback between the 1980s and 2000s is substantially more negative than the long-term cloud feedback. This is a result of cooling in tropical regions where air descends, relative to warming in tropical ascent regions, which strengthens low-level atmospheric stability. Under these conditions, low-level cloud cover and its reflection of solar radiation increase, despite an increase in global mean surface temperature. These results suggest that sea surface temperature pattern-induced low cloud anomalies could have contributed to the period of reduced warming between 1998 and 2013, and offer a physical explanation of why climate sensitivities estimated from recently observed trends are probably biased low4.","Chen Zhou, Mark D.

We find a significant and robust correlation between the east-west contrast of dynamic sea level (DSL) in the Pacific and global mean surface temperature (GST) variability on both interannual and decadal time scales. Based on linear regression of the multimodel ensemble mean, the anomalously fast SLR in the western tropical Pacific observed during 1998?2012 indicates suppression of a potential global surface warming of 0.16ø?ñ?0.06øC.

Here we demonstrate that the remote impact of Atlantic SST anomalies, as well as local atmosphere-ocean interactions, contributed to the eastern Pacific cooling during this period. By assimilating observed three-dimensional Atlantic temperature and salinity anomalies into a coupled general circulation model, we are able to qualitatively reproduce the observed Pacific decadal trends of SST and sea level pressure (SLP), albeit with reduced amplitude. Although a major part of the Pacific SLP trend can be explained by equatorial Pacific SST forcing only, the origin of this low-frequency variability can be traced back further to the remote impacts of equatorial Atlantic and South Atlantic SST trends.

An unforced internal component that varies on multidecadal time scales is identified by a new statistical method that maximizes integral time scale. This component, called the internal multidecadal pattern (IMP), is stochastic and hence does not contribute to trends on long time scales; however, it can contribute significantly to short-term trends. Observational estimates indicate that the trend in the spatially averaged ?well observed? sea surface temperature (SST) due to the forced component has an approximately constant value of 0.1 K decade?1, while the IMP can contribute about ñ0.08 K decade?1 for a 30-yr trend. The warming and cooling of the IMP matches that of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and is of sufficient amplitude to explain the acceleration in warming during 1977?2008 as compared to 1946?77, despite the forced component increasing at the same rate during these two periods. The amplitude and time scale of the IMP are such that its contribution to the trend dominates that of the forced component on time scales shorter than 16 yr, implying that the lack of warming trend during the past 10 yr is not statistically significant. Furthermore, since the IMP varies naturally on multidecadal time scales, it is potentially predictable on decadal time scales, providing a scientific rationale for decadal predictions. While the IMP can contribute significantly to trends for periods of 30 yr or shorter, it cannot account for the 0.8øC warming that has been observed in the twentieth-century spatially averaged SST.","Timothy DelSole, Michael K.

Efforts to identify the causes of the hiatus that compare simulations from experiments run by climate models raise several statistical issues. Specifically, it is necessary to identify whether an experiment?s inability to simulate the hiatus is unique to this period or reflects a more systematic failure throughout the sample period. Furthermore, efforts to attribute the hiatus to a particular factor by including that mechanism in an experimental treatment must improve the model?s performance in a statistically significant manner at the time of the hiatus. Sample-wide assessments of simulation errors can provide an accurate assessment of whether or not the control experiment uniquely fails at the hiatus, and can identify its causes using experimental treatments. We use this approach to determine if the hiatus constitutes a unique failure in simulated climate models and to re-examine the conclusion that the hiatus is uniquely linked to episodes of La Ni¤a-like cooling (Kosaka and Xie 2013). Using statistical techniques that do not define the hiatus a priori, we find no evidence that the slowdown in temperature increases are uniquely tied to episodes of La Ni¤a-like cooling.","Felix Pretis, Michael L.

Comparing observed surface temperature trends against the simulated ones by the CMIP5 historical experiments especially in the zonal mean context suggests that although the anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) forcing has played a major role, in addition to the anthropogenic aerosols and various natural forcings, the effects from decadal-to-interdecadal-scale internal modes specifically the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are also very strong. Evident temperature changes associated with the PDO?s phase shift are seen in the Pacific basin, with decadal-scale cooling in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and most of the east basin and concurrent warming in the subtropics of both hemispheres, even though the PDO?s net effect on global mean temperature is relatively weak. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) also changed its phase in the mid-1990s, and hence its possible impact is estimated and assessed as well. However, comparisons with CMIP5 simulations suggest that the AMO may have not contributed as significantly as the PDO in terms of the changes/trends in global surface temperature, even though the data analysis technique used here suggests otherwise. Long-term precipitation changes or trends during the post-1979 period are further shown to have been modulated by the two major factors: anthropogenic GHG and PDO, in addition to the relatively weak effects from aerosols and natural forcings. The spatial patterns of observed precipitation trends in the Pacific, including reductions in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and increases in the tropical western Pacific and along the South Pacific Convergence Zone, manifest the PDO?s contributions. Removing the PDO effect from the total precipitation trends makes the spatial structures of precipitation trends more similar to those simulated by CMIP5 historical full forcing experiments particularly in the context of zonal-mean results. This also confirms that in spite of the PDO effect specifically on regional scales, the anthropogenic GHG signals are still discernible in observed precipitation during the time period. Following the increase of GHG, precipitation tends to increase roughly along the climatological ITCZ and decrease south of the equator and in the subtropics of both hemispheres.","Guojun Gu, Robert F.

This discrepancy has become known as the global warming ?hiatus? and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed slowdown in warming. Focusing on internally generated variability, we use pre-industrial control simulations from an observationally constrained ensemble of GCMs and a statistical approach to evaluate the expected frequency and characteristics of variability-driven hiatus periods and their likelihood of future continuation. Given an expected forced warming trend of ~0.2 K per decade, our constrained ensemble of GCMs implies that the probability of a variability-driven 10-year hiatus is ~10%, but less than 1% for a 20-year hiatus. Although the absolute probability of a 20-year hiatus is small, the probability that an existing 15-year hiatus will continue another five years is much higher (up to 25%). Therefore, given the recognized contribution of internal climate variability to the reduced rate of global warming during the past 15 years, we should not be surprised if the current hiatus continues until the end of the decade. Following the termination of a variability-driven hiatus, we also show that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming associated with release of heat from the sub-surface ocean and a reversal of the phase of decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean.","C.

A key mode of internal variability is the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which contributed to a reduced GMST trend during the early 2000s1, 2, 3. We use a novel, physical phenomenon-based approach to quantify the contribution from a source of internally generated multidecadal variability?the IPO?to multidecadal GMST trends. Here we show that the largest IPO contributions occurred in its positive phase during the rapid warming periods from 1910?1941 and 1971?1995, with the IPO contributing 71% and 75%, respectively, to the difference between the median values of the externally forced trends and observed trends. The IPO transition from positive to negative in the late-1990s contributed 27% of the discrepancy between model median estimates of the forced part of the GMST trend and the observed trend from 1995 to 2013, with additional contributions that are probably due to internal variability outside of the Pacific4 and an externally forced response from small volcanic eruptions5. Understanding and quantifying the contribution of a specific source of internally generated variability?the IPO?to GMST trends is necessary to improve decadal climate prediction skill.","Gerald A.

Here we investigate multi-decadal variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), Northern Hemisphere sea-ice extent and global mean temperature (GMT) in an ensemble of CMIP5 models under control conditions. We report an inter-annual GMT variability of about ñ0.1ø C originating solely from natural variability in the model ensemble. By decomposing the GMT variance into contributions of the AMOC and Northern Hemisphere sea-ice extent using a graph-theoretical statistical approach, we find the AMOC to contribute 8% to GMT variability in the ensemble mean. Our results highlight the importance of AMOC sea-ice feedbacks that explain 5% of the GMT variance, while the contribution solely related to the AMOC is found to be about 3%. As a consequence of multi-decadal AMOC variability, we report substantial variations in North Atlantic deep-ocean heat content with trends of up to 0.7 ? 1022 J decade?1 that are of the order of observed changes over the last decade and consistent with the reduced GMT warming trend over this period. Although these temperature anomalies are largely density-compensated by salinity changes, we find a robust negative correlation between the AMOC and North Atlantic deep-ocean density with density lagging the AMOC by 5 to 11 yr in most models. While this would in principle allow for a self-sustained oscillatory behavior of the coupled AMOC?deep-ocean system, our results are inconclusive about the role of this feedback in the model ensemble.","C.

External forcing influences the predictions throughout, but their contributions to predictive skill become dominant after most of the improved skill from initialization with observations vanishes after about 6?9 years. Recent multimodel results suggest that there is relatively more decadal predictive skill in the North Atlantic, western Pacific, and Indian Oceans than in other regions of the world oceans. Aspects of decadal variability of SSTs, like the mid-1970s shift in the Pacific, the mid-1990s shift in the northern North Atlantic and western Pacific, and the early-2000s hiatus, are better represented in initialized hindcasts compared to uninitialized simulations. There is evidence of higher skill in initialized multimodel ensemble decadal hindcasts than in single model results, with multimodel initialized predictions for near-term climate showing somewhat less global warming than uninitialized simulations. Some decadal hindcasts have shown statistically reliable predictions of surface temperature over various land and ocean regions for lead times of up to 6?9 years, but this needs to be investigated in a wider set of models. As in the early days of El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction, improvements to models will reduce the need for bias adjustment, and increase the reliability, and thus usefulness, of decadal climate predictions in the future.","Gerald A.

Here, we examine OHC changes in the context of the Earth?s global energy budget since early in the industrial era (circa 1865?2015) for a range of depths. We rely on OHC change estimates from a diverse collection of measurement systems including data from the nineteenth-century Challenger expedition12, a multi-decadal record of ship-based in situ mostly upper-ocean measurements, the more recent near-global Argo floats profiling to intermediate (2,000?m) depths13, and full-depth repeated transoceanic sections5. We show that the multi-model mean constructed from the current generation of historically forced climate models is consistent with the OHC changes from this diverse collection of observational systems. Our model-based analysis suggests that nearly half of the industrial-era increases in global OHC have occurred in recent decades, with over a third of the accumulated heat occurring below 700?m and steadily rising.","Peter J.

Observational analysis shows that the NAO leads both the detrended NHT and oceanic Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) by 15?20?years. Theoretical analysis illuminates that the NAO precedes NHT multidecadal variability through its delayed effect on the AMO due to the large thermal inertia associated with slow oceanic processes. An NAO-based linear model is therefore established to predict the NHT, which gives an excellent hindcast for NHT in 1971?2011 with the recent flat trend well predicted. NHT in 2012?2027 is predicted to fall slightly over the next decades, due to the recent NAO decadal weakening that temporarily offsets the anthropogenically induced warming.","Jianping Li, Cheng Sun, Fei-Fei Jin",2013,GRL,40,20,5497?5502,05-09-13,24-10-13,10.1002/2013GL057877,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013GL057877/full,,1,,1,En

In this study, the evolution of the surface temperature of the global land-mean and Eurasia middle-high latitudes during the global warming hiatus was analyzed based on CRU observations. Simulations and projections were also evaluated using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). The results indicate that, in the global warming hiatus period, the trend of the global land-mean surface temperature is only 0.14? (10 a)-1, which is half that during 1976-1999. The trend is less than that before 2000 in nine of the 13 global land regions, and four of them show a decreasing trend. The Eurasia middle-high latitude region is the most interesting among all the regions. For 1976-1999, the Eurasia middle-high latitude region shows the largest warming among all the land regions and reaches 0.50? (10 a)-1. After 2000, the trend significantly declines to -0.17? (10 a)-1, the greatest cooling trend over land, globally, contributing 49.13% of the remarkable change in global land surface temperatures before and after 2000. Furthermore, the surface temperature of the Eurasia middle-high latitude region shows an opposite change in autumn and winter after 2000; the temperature of the former rises by 0.86?

Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments (e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)). As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5). The core simulations replay the 20?21st century (1920?2100) 30 times under historical and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-year long pre-industrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on 20th?21st century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5.

During the hiatus, the tropical Pacific Ocean displays a La Ni¤a-like cooling pattern while sea surface temperature (SST) in the Indian Ocean has continued to increase. This SST pattern differs from the well-known La Ni¤a-induced basin-wide cooling across the Indian Ocean on the interannual timescale. Here, based on model experiments, we show that the SST pattern during the hiatus explains pronounced regional anomalies of rainfall in the Asian monsoon region and thermodynamic effects due to specific humidity change are secondary. Specifically, Indo-Pacific SST anomalies cause convection to intensify over the tropical western Pacific, which in turn suppresses rainfall in mid-latitude East Asia through atmospheric teleconnection.

Regarding recent times, attribution studies have shown that greenhouse gases (GHGs) determined the trend of temperature (T) in the last half century, while circulation patterns contributed to modify its interannual, decadal, or multidecadal behavior over this period. Here temperature predictions based on vector autoregressive models (VARs) have been used to study the influence of GHGs and El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on recent temperature behavior. It is found that in the last decades of steep temperature increase, ENSO shows just a very short-range influence on T, while GHGs are dominant for each forecast horizon. Conversely and quite surprisingly, in the previous quasi-stationary period the influences of GHGs and ENSO are comparable, even at longer range. Therefore, if the recent hiatus in global temperatures should persist into the near future, an enhancement of the role of ENSO can be expected.

Declining solar insolation as part of a normal eleven-year cycle, and a cyclical change from an El Nino to a La Nina dominate our measure of anthropogenic effects because rapid growth in short-lived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations.

The superimposition of a secular warming trend with natural multidecadal variability is the most accepted explanation for such a pattern. Since the start of the 21st century, the surface global mean temperature has not risen at the same rate as the top-of-atmosphere radiative energy input or greenhouse gas emissions, provoking scientific and social interest in determining the causes of this apparent discrepancy. Multidecadal natural variability is the most commonly proposed cause for the present hiatus period. Here, we analyze the HadCRUT4 surface temperature database with spectral techniques to separate a multidecadal oscillation (MDV) from a secular trend (ST). Both signals combined account for nearly 88% of the total variability of the temperature series showing the main acceleration/deceleration periods already described elsewhere. Three stalling periods with very little warming could be found within the series, from 1878 to 1907, from 1945 to 1969 and from 2001 to the end of the series, all of them coincided with a cooling phase of the MDV. Henceforth, MDV seems to be the main cause of the different hiatus periods shown by the global surface temperature records. However, and contrary to the two previous events, during the current hiatus period, the ST shows a strong fluctuation on the warming rate, with a large acceleration (0.0085øC year?1 to 0.017øC year?1) during 1992?2001 and a sharp deceleration (0.017øC year?1 to 0.003øC year?1) from 2002 onwards. This is the first time in the observational record that the ST shows such variability, so determining the causes and consequences of this change of behavior needs to be addressed by the scientific community.","Diego Macias, Adolf Stips, Elisa Garcia-Gorriz",2014,PLoS ONE,9,9,e107222,28-03-14,10-09-14,10.1371/journal.pone.0107222,http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0107222,,1,,,En

Yet, global temperature trends show little warming over the most recent decade or so. For longer time periods appropriate to the assessment of trends, however, global temperatures have experienced significant warming trends for all seasons except winter, when cooling trends exist instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia. Hence, the most recent lapse in global warming is a seasonal phenomenon, prevalent only in boreal winter. Additionally, we show that the largest regional contributor to global temperature trends over the past two decades is land surface temperatures in the NH extratropics. Therefore, proposed mechanisms explaining the fluctuations in global annual temperatures should address this apparent seasonal asymmetry.","Judah L. Cohen, Jason C.

But the trend in sun?s output, after removing solar activity effect, does not match with the long term trend of global temperature.

However, the attribution of the observed warming to human activities remains less clear, particularly because of the apparent slow-down in warming since the late 1990s. Here we analyse radiative forcing and temperature time series with state-of-the-art statistical methods to address this question without climate model simulations. We show that long-term trends in total radiative forcing and temperatures have largely been determined by atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and modulated by other radiative factors. We identify a pronounced increase in the growth rates of both temperatures and radiative forcing around 1960, which marks the onset of sustained global warming. Our analyses also reveal a contribution of human interventions to two periods when global warming slowed down. Our statistical analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, as well as a reduction in methane emissions, contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s. Furthermore, we identify a contribution from the two world wars and the Great Depression to the documented cooling in the mid-twentieth century, through lower carbon dioxide emissions. We conclude that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are effective in slowing the rate of warming in the short term.","Francisco Estrada, Pierre Perron, Benjam¡n Mart¡nez-L¢pez",2013,Nature Geoscience,6,12,1050-1055,28-02-13,10-11-13,10.1038/ngeo1999,http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n12/abs/ngeo1999.html,,1,,,En

Here we show that both Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) may cause fluctuations of the global mean surface air temperature (SAT) and hence alternately positive and negative trends on (inter)decadal time scales. However, the forced SAT change under a mean state due to greenhouse gas forcing does not depend on different phases of AMV and PDO, implying the effect of the FCC and internally generated climate variability can be linearly added up to the observed transient global mean SAT. On the other hand, the regional patterns of transient FCC do depend on the phases of the internal variability since the atmospheric and oceanic circulations can be affected by the different phases of the internal variability. Our results suggest a two-way interaction between internal variability and spatial patterns of FCC.","Jianhua Lu, Aixue Hu, Zhen Zeng",2014,GRL,41,8,2962?2970,13-03-14,30-04-14,10.1002/2014GL059908,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059908/abstract,,1,,,En

Using a sea level budget approach, we compare altimetry-based global mean sea level, global ocean mass from GRACE space gravimetry and steric sea level from Argo and other in situ measurements. One goal of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to constrain the deep ocean contribution to the global mean sea level rise over the last decade. This question is particularly relevant, considering the current debate about the ?hiatus,? i.e., the observed recent pause of the global mean air and sea surface temperature evolution while the planet is still in thermal imbalance. We consider a total of 16 different data sets. Differences are noticed between data sets related to each variable (sea level, ocean mass and steric sea level), mostly due to data processing issues. Therefore, we perform the analysis using averages of the available data sets. For each period, we find that, when removing from the global mean sea level, the contributions of the global mean ocean mass and steric sea level (estimated for the 0?1,500 m ocean layer), there remains a residual signal displaying a positive slope of 0.3 ñ 0.6 and 0.55 ñ 0.6 mm/year over 2005?2012 and 2003?2012, respectively. Comparing with an ocean reanalysis and according to direct (but sparse) ocean temperature measurements below 1,500 m, it seems unlikely that the observed residual signal can be attributed to deep (below 1,500 m) ocean warming, in agreement with other recently published results. We estimate that it possibly reflects, at least partly, the signature of a missing upper ocean steric signal in regions uncovered by current observing systems. Our study also shows a steady warming increase since 2003 of the 700?1,500 m ocean layer (amounting ~0.2 mm/year in steric sea level equivalent), confirming previous findings, but seen in our study in each of the eight different steric data sets considered.","Habib B.

This study investigates whether this warming hiatus results from a change in the well-known greenhouse effect. Using long-term, reliable, and consistent observational data from the Earth?s surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA), two monthly gridded atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect parameters (Ga and Gs) are estimated to represent the radiative warming effects of the atmosphere and the surface in the infrared range from 1979 to 2014. The atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect over the tropical monsoon-prone regions is found to contribute substantially to the global total. Furthermore, the downward tendency of cloud activity leads to a greenhouse effect hiatus after the early 1990?s, prior to the warming pause. Additionally, this pause in the greenhouse effect is mostly caused by the high number of La Ni¤a events between 1991 and 2014. A strong La Ni¤a indicates suppressed convection in the tropical central Pacific that reduces atmospheric water vapor content and cloud volume. This significantly weakened regional greenhouse effect offsets the enhanced warming influence in other places and decelerates the rising global greenhouse effect. This work suggests that the greenhouse effect hiatus can be served as an additional factor to cause the recent global warming slowdown.","Jinjie Song, Yuan Wang, Jianping Tang",2016,Scientific Reports,6,,33315,17-02-16,24-08-16,10.1038/srep33315,http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33315,,1,,,En

Here, it is shown that the hiatus in the rate of global warming typically occurs when the internally generated cooling associated with the cool phase of the multi-decadal variability overcomes the secular warming from human-induced forcing. We provide compelling evidence that the global warming hiatus is a natural product of the interplays between a secular warming tendency due in a large part to the buildup of anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, in particular CO2 concentration, and internally generated cooling by a cool phase of a quasi-60-year oscillatory variability that is closely associated with the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). We further illuminate that the AMO can be considered as a useful indicator and the PDO can be implicated as a harbinger of variations in global annual average surface temperature on multi-decadal timescales. Our results suggest that the recent observed hiatus in the rate of global warming will very likely extend for several more years due to the cooling phase of the quasi-60-year oscillatory variability superimposed on the secular warming trend.","Shuai-Lei Yao, Gang Huang, Ren-Guang Wu, Xia Qu",2016,Theoretical and Applied Climatology,123,1,349-360,26-06-14,09-01-15,10.1007/s00704-014-1358-x,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-014-1358-x,,1,,,En

We show that there are frequent fluctuations in the rate of warming around a longer-term warming trend, and that there is no evidence that identifies the recent period as unique or particularly unusual. In confirmation, we show that the notion of a ?pause? in warming is considered to be misleading in a blind expert test. Nonetheless, the most recent fluctuation about the longer-term trend has been regarded by many as an explanatory challenge that climate science must resolve. This departs from long-standing practice, insofar as scientists have long recognized that the climate fluctuates, that linear increases in CO2 do not produce linear trends in global warming, and that 15-year (or shorter) periods are not diagnostic of long-term trends. We suggest that the repetition of the ?warming has paused? message by contrarians was adopted by the scientific community in its problem-solving and answer-seeking role and has led to undue focus on, and mislabeling of, a recent fluctuation. We present an alternative framing that could have avoided inadvertently reinforcing a misleading claim.","Stephan Lewandowsky, James S.

We find, however, that heat redistribution in the upper 350?m between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is closely tied to the surface warming hiatus. The Indian Ocean shows an anomalous warming below 50?m during hiatus events due to an enhanced heat transport by the Indonesian throughflow in response to the intensified trade winds in the equatorial Pacific. Thus, the Pacific and Indian Oceans are the key regions to track ocean heat uptake during the surface warming hiatus.","Wei Liu, Shang-Ping Xie, Jian Lu",2016,Nature Communications,7,,10926,17-06-15,30-03-16,10.1038/ncomms10926,http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160330/ncomms10926/full/ncomms10926.html,,1,,,En

There was another global warming hiatus event during 1940s?1960s. The roles of the external forcing and the natural variability in both global warming hiatuses are explored, using EOF analysis. The first two leading EOF modes of the 5-year running mean global sea surface temperature (SST) reflect the global warming scenario (EOF1) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO)-like natural variability (EOF2), respectively. In observation, PC2 was in its positive phase (eastern Pacific cooling) during 1940s?1960s, which contributed to the previous warming hiatus. In addition, GMST trends are found to be negative during late 1950s and 1960s in most of the CMIP5 historical runs, which implies that the external forcing also contributed to the pause in the GMST rising. It is further demonstrated that it is the natural radiative forcing (volcanic forcing) that caused the drop-down of GMST in 1960s. The current global warming hiatus has been attributed to the eastern Pacific cooling/enhanced Pacific trade winds. It is shown that the PC2 switched to its positive phase in late 1990s, and hence the IPO-like natural variability made a contribution to the slowdown of GMST rising in the past decade. It is also found that the EOF1 mode (global warming mode) of the observed SST features a smaller warming in tropical Pacific compared to the Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic. Such inter-basin warming contrast, which is attributed to the ?ocean thermostat? mechanism, has been suggested to contribute to the intensification of Pacific trade winds since late 1990s as well.

Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, create an energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) even as the planet warms to adjust to this imbalance, which is estimated to be 0.5?1?W?m?2 over the 2000s. Annual global fluctuations in TOA energy of up to 0.2?W?m?2 occur from natural variations in clouds, aerosols, and changes in the Sun. At times of major volcanic eruptions the effects can be much larger. Yet global mean surface temperatures fluctuate much more than these can account for. An energy imbalance is manifested not just as surface atmospheric or ground warming but also as melting sea and land ice, and heating of the oceans. More than 90% of the heat goes into the oceans and, with melting land ice, causes sea level to rise. For the past decade, more than 30% of the heat has apparently penetrated below 700?m depth that is traceable to changes in surface winds mainly over the Pacific in association with a switch to a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1999. Surface warming was much more in evidence during the 1976?1998 positive phase of the PDO, suggesting that natural decadal variability modulates the rate of change of global surface temperatures while sea-level rise is more relentless.

Cooling periods associated with the latter deeper heat-sequestration mechanism historically lasted 20 to 35 years.","Xianyao Chen, Ka-Kit Tung",2014,Science,345,6199,897-903,17-04-14,22-08-14,10.1126/science.1254937,http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/897.short,,1,,,En

This intensity is among the highest ever observed for tropical cyclones (TCs) globally, 35 kts well above the threshold (135kts) of the existing highest category of 5. Though there is speculation to associate global warming with such intensity, existing research indicate that we have been in a warming hiatus period, with the hiatus attributed to the La Ni¤a-like multi-decadal phenomenon. It is thus intriguing to understand why Haiyan can occur during hiatus. It is suggested that as the western Pacific manifestation of the La Ni¤a-like phenomenon is to pile up warm subsurface water to the west, the western North Pacific experienced evident subsurface warming and created a very favorable ocean pre-condition for Haiyan. Together with its fast traveling speed, the air-sea flux supply was 158% as compared to normal for intensification.","I.-I.

A new proxy extension of the global temperature record enables better placement of this feature in a longer historical perspective. The fixed-grid composite covers the interval 1801?1984, with an extension to 1782, and anchors the global temperature record in the last major cold interval of the Little Ice Age, when carbon dioxide concentration was at preanthropogenic levels. Except for greater and longer cooling (approximately twice the length of Pinatubo) associated with the Tambora eruption, the proxy agrees with the most widely cited previous assessment of global temperature over this interval, lending more confidence to a centennial extension of the global temperature record. The proxy correlation is as high as 0.83 for the interval 1907?1984 (df?=?8, p?=?0.001), with the 21st century 1.0øC?ñ?0.2øC warmer than the nonvolcanic base state. This remarkable linearity requires a clear theoretical understanding as to how an exceedingly complex system can, on the global average, behave in such a simple way. Removal of the linear radiatively forced component from the global temperature record yields an estimate of natural variability for the last 230 years and indicates no unusual natural variability during the recent 10?15 years. Based on the estimate of unforced variability over the last 170 years, there is about a 40% chance of continued ?natural cooling? over the next few years, with about a 10% chance of cooling persisting into the next decade.","Thomas J.

For 1999 to 2012, the hiatus in surface warming is mainly evident in the central and eastern Pacific. It is manifested as strong anomalous easterly trade winds, distinctive sea-level pressure patterns, and large rainfall anomalies in the Pacific, which resemble the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These features are accompanied by upper tropospheric teleconnection wave patterns that extend throughout the Pacific, to polar regions, and into the Atlantic. The extratropical features are particularly strong during winter. By using an idealized heating to force a comprehensive atmospheric model, the large negative anomalous latent heating associated with the observed deficit in central tropical Pacific rainfall is shown to be mainly responsible for the global quasi-stationary waves in the upper troposphere. The wave patterns in turn created persistent regional climate anomalies, increasing the odds of cold winters in Europe. Hence, tropical Pacific forcing of the atmosphere such as that associated with a negative phase of the PDO produces many of the pronounced atmospheric circulation anomalies observed globally during the hiatus.","Kevin E.

Here we use lidar, Aerosol Robotic Network, and balloon-borne observations to provide evidence that currently available satellite databases neglect substantial amounts of volcanic aerosol between the tropopause and 15?km at middle to high latitudes and therefore underestimate total radiative forcing resulting from the recent eruptions. Incorporating these estimates into a simple climate model, we determine the global volcanic aerosol forcing since 2000 to be ?0.19?ñ?0.09?Wm?2.

The corresponding intensification of the atmospheric Walker circulation is also associated with sea surface cooling in the eastern Pacific, which has been identified as one of the contributors to the current pause in global surface warming. In spite of recent progress in determining the climatic impacts of the Pacific trade wind acceleration, the cause of this pronounced trend in atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we analyse a series of climate model experiments along with observational data to show that the recent warming trend in Atlantic sea surface temperature and the corresponding trans-basin displacements of the main atmospheric pressure centres were key drivers of the observed Walker circulation intensification, eastern Pacific cooling, North American rainfall trends and western Pacific sea-level rise.

Here we present an analysis based on sea-level data from the altimetry record of the past  ~20 years that separates interannual natural variability in sea level from the longer-term change probably related to anthropogenic global warming. The most prominent signature in the global mean sea level interannual variability is caused by El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation, through its impact on the global water cycle. We find that when correcting for interannual variability, the past decade?s slowdown of the global mean sea level disappears, leading to a similar rate of sea-level rise (of 3.3 ñ 0.4 mm yr?1) during the first and second decade of the altimetry era.

One can thus use a specific period in a much longer record to arbitrarily determine the sign of long-term trend, which is statistically significant, in regional SST. This could lead to a controversial conclusion on how global SST responded to the anthropogenic forcing in the recent history. In this study, the uncertainty in the linear trend due to multi-scale internal variation is theoretically investigated. It is found that the ?estimated? trend will not change its sign only when its magnitude is greater than a theoretical threshold that scales the influence from the multi-scale internal variation. Otherwise, the sign of the ?estimated? trend may depend on the period used. The new criterion is found to be superior over the existing methods when the de-trended time series is dominated by the oscillatory term. Applying this new criterion to a global SST reconstruction from 1881 to 2013 reveals that the influences from multi-scale internal variation on the sign of ?estimated? linear trend cannot be excluded in most parts of the Pacific, the southern Indian Ocean and the northern Atlantic; therefore, the warming or/and cooling trends found in these regions cannot be interpreted as the consequences of anthropogenic forcing.

Here, a new and improved means to quantify the coupling between climate modes confirms that another synchronization of these modes, followed by an increase in coupling occurred in 2001/02.

The results are used to discuss the so-called global-warming hiatus during 1998?2012. It is demonstrated that different beginning and end times have an obvious effect on the results of the trend estimation, and the implications are particularly large when using a short window. The global-warming hiatus during 1998?2012 is the result of viewing temperature series on short timescales; and the events similar to it, or the events with even cold tendencies, have actually occurred many times in history. Therefore, the global-warming hiatus is likely to be a periodical feature of the long-term temperature change.

A natural variability was superimposed on a linear warming trend due to the increasing radiative forcing of CO2. The result demonstrates that the superposition of the natural variability and the background linear trend can offset with each other to show the warming hiatus for some period. It is also stressed that the rapid warming during 1970?2000 can be explained by the superposition of the natural variability and the background linear trend at least within the simple model. The key process of the fluctuating planetary albedo in multi-decadal time scale is investigated using the JRA-55 reanalysis data. It is found that the planetary albedo increased for 1958?1970, decreased for 1970?2000, and increased for 2000?2012, as expected by the simple EBM experiments. The multi-decadal variability in the planetary albedo is compared with the time series of the AO mode and Barents Sea mode of surface air temperature. It is shown that the recent AO negative pattern showing warm Arctic and cold mid-latitudes is in good agreement with planetary albedo change indicating negative anomaly in high latitudes and positive anomaly in mid-latitudes. Moreover, the Barents Sea mode with the warm Barents Sea and cold mid-latitudes shows long-term variability similar to planetary albedo change. Although further studies are needed, the natural variabilities of both the AO mode and Barents Sea mode indicate some possible link to the planetary albedo as suggested by the simple EBM to cause the warming hiatus in recent years.","Hiroshi L.

Here, we introduce four key episodes in GMST evolution, according to different phases of the MDV extracted by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method from the ensemble HadCRUT4 monthly GMST time series. The ?warming/cooling hiatus? and ?typical warming/cooling? periods are defined as the 95% confidence intervals for the locations of local MDV maxima/minima and of their derivatives, respectively. Since 1850, the warming hiatuses, cooling hiatuses and typical warming have already occurred three times, and the typical cooling, twice. At present, the MDV is in its third warming hiatus period, which started in 2012 and would last until 2017, followed by a 30-year cooling episode, while the trend will sustain the current steady growth in the next 50 years.

We apply a rigorous, comprehensive statistical analysis of global temperature data that goes beyond simple linear models to account for temporal dependence and selection effects. We use this framework to test whether the recent period has demonstrated i) a hiatus in the trend in global temperatures, ii) a temperature trend that is statistically distinct from trends prior to the hiatus period, iii) a ?stalling? of the global mean temperature, and iv) a change in the distribution of the year-to-year temperature increases. We find compelling evidence that recent claims of a ?hiatus? in global warming lack sound scientific basis.

In particular, I focus on the use of ocean observations to initialize predictions in ocean and climate models. Examples are also shown of how models can be used to assess the impact of both current ocean observations and to simulate that of potential new ocean observing platforms. The ocean has never been better observed than it is today and similarly ocean models have never been as capable at representing the real ocean as they are now. However, there remain important unanswered questions that can likely only be addressed via future improvements in ocean observations. In particular, ocean observing systems need to respond to the needs of the burgeoning field of near-term climate predictions. Although new ocean observing platforms promise exciting new discoveries, there is a delicate balance to be made between their funding and that of the current ocean observing system. Here, I identify the need to secure long-term funding for ocean observing platforms as they mature, from a mainly research exercise to an operational system for sustained observation over climate change time scales.

The use of ocean observations to understand the prominent long time scale changes observed in the North Atlantic is another focus of this paper. The exciting first decade of monitoring of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation by the RAPID-MOCHA array is highlighted.

Many coastal ecosystem disasters, caused by extreme sea surface temperature (SST), were reported when the global climate shifted from global warming to global surface warming hiatus after 1998. The task of understanding the coastal SST variations within the global context is an urgent matter. Our study on the global coastal SST from 1982 to 2013 revealed a significant cooling trend in the low and mid latitudes (31.4% of the global coastlines) after 1998, while 17.9% of the global coastlines changed from a cooling trend to a warming trend concurrently. The trend reversals in the Northern Pacific and Atlantic coincided with the phase shift of Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, respectively. These coastal SST changes are larger than the changes of the global mean and open ocean, resulting in a fast increase of extremely hot/cold days, and thus extremely hot/cold events. Meanwhile, a continuous increase of SST was detected for a considerable portion of coastlines (46.7%) with a strengthened warming along the coastlines in the high northern latitudes. This suggests the warming still continued and strengthened in some regions after 1998, but with a weaker pattern in the low and mid latitudes.","Enhui Liao, Wenfang Lu, Xiao-Hai Yan, Yuwu Jiang, Autumn Kidwell",2015,Scientific Reports,5,,16630,16-06-15,16-11-15,10.1038/srep16630,http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16630,1,,,,En

In contrast to the cooling trend in the rest of China, and the global warming hiatus post-1990s, an accelerated warming trend has appeared over the Tibetan Plateau during 1998?2013 (0.25?øC decade?1), compared with that during 1980?1997 (0.21?øC decade?1). Further results indicate that, to some degree, such an accelerated warming trend might be attributable to cloud?radiation feedback. The increased nocturnal cloud over the northern Tibetan Plateau would warm the nighttime temperature via enhanced atmospheric back-radiation, while the decreased daytime cloud over the southern Tibetan Plateau would induce the daytime sunshine duration to increase, resulting in surface air temperature warming. Meanwhile, the in situ surface wind speed has recovered gradually since 1998, and thus the energy concentration cannot explain the accelerated warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau after the 1990s. It is suggested that cloud?radiation feedback may play an important role in modulating the recent accelerated warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau.","Anmin Duan, Zhixiang Xiao",2015,Scientific Reports,5,,13711,19-03-15,02-09-15,10.1038/srep13711,http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13711,1,,,,En

Many studies have attributed the current warming hiatus to internal climate variability (ICV). But there is less work on discussion of the dynamics about how these ICV modes influence cooling over land in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Here we demonstrate the warming hiatus was more significant over the continental NH. We explored the dynamics of the warming hiatus from a global perspective and investigated the mechanisms of the reversing from accelerated warming to hiatus, and how ICV modes influence SAT change throughout the NH land. It was found that these ICV modes and Arctic amplification can excite a decadal modulated oscillation (DMO), which enhances or suppresses the long-term trend on decadal to multi-decadal timescales. When the DMO is in an upward (warming) phase, it contributes to an accelerated warming trend, as in last 20 years of twentieth-century. It appears that there is a downward swing in the DMO occurring at present, which has balanced or reduced the radiative forced warming and resulted in the recent global warming hiatus. The DMO modulates the SAT, in particular, the SAT of boreal cold months, through changes in the asymmetric meridional and zonal thermal forcing (MTF and ZTF). The MTF represents the meridional temperature gradients between the mid- and high-latitudes, and the ZTF represents the asymmetry in temperatures between the extratropical large-scale warm and cold zones in the zonal direction. Via the different performance of combined MTF and ZTF, we found that the DMO?s modulation effect on SAT was strongest when both weaker (stronger) MTF and stronger (weaker) ZTF occurred simultaneously. And the current hiatus is a result of a downward DMO combined with a weaker MTF and stronger ZTF, which stimulate both a weaker polar vortex and westerly winds, along with the amplified planetary waves, thereby facilitating southward invasion of cold Arctic-air and promoting the blocking formation. The results conclude that the DMO can not only be used to interpret the current warming hiatus, it also suggests that global warming will accelerate again when it swings upward.","Jianping Huang, Yongkun Xie, Xiaodan Guan, Dongdong Li, Fei Ji",2017,Climate Dynamics,48,1,429-446,28-09-15,09-05-16,10.1007/s00382-016-3085-8,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3085-8,,1,,,En

This study examined winter WCT over Northern Asia during 1973?2013 by analysing in situ station data. The winter WCT warming rate over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) slowed during 1999?2013 (?0.04?øC?decade?1) compared with that of during 1973?1998 (0.67?øC?decade?1). The winter WCT warming hiatus has also been observed in the remainder of Northern Asia with trends of 1.11?øC?decade?1 during 1973?1998 but ?1.02?øC?decade?1 during 1999?2013, except for the Far East (FE) of Russia, where the winter WCT has continued to heat up during both the earlier period of 1973?1998 (0.54?øC?decade?1) and the recent period of 1999?2013 (0.75?øC?decade?1). The results indicate that the influence of temperature on winter WCT is greater than that of wind speed over Northern Asia. Atmospheric circulation changes associated with air temperature and wind speed were analysed to identify the causes for the warming hiatus of winter WCT over Northern Asia. The distributions of sea-level pressure and 500-hPa height anomalies during 1999?2013 transported cold air from the high latitudes to middle latitudes, resulting in low air temperature over Northern Asia except for the FE of Russia. Over the TP, the increase in wind speed offset the increase in air temperature during 1999?2013. For the FE, the southerly wind from the Western Pacific drove the temperature up during the 1999?2013 period through warm advection.","Ying Ma, Rui Mao, Sheng-Hui Feng, Dao-Yi Gong, Seong-Joong Kim",2016,International Journal of Climatology,,,,07-04-16,16-10-16,10.1002/joc.4905,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4905/full,1,,,,En

This report reviews these issues and also posits insights from a collective set of diverse information that helps us understand what we do and do not know. One salient insight is that the GMST phenomenon is a surface characteristic that does not represent a slowdown in warming of the climate system but rather is an energy redistribution within the oceans. Improved understanding of the ocean distribution and redistribution of heat will help better monitor Earth's energy budget and its consequences. A review of recent scientific publications on the ?hiatus? shows the difficulty and complexities in pinpointing the oceanic sink of the ?missing heat? from the atmosphere and the upper layer of the oceans, which defines the ?hiatus.?

Results indicate the following: i) Almost all stations have experienced a notable warming in the time interval 1961 to 2014, with most obvious warming in winter which depends on the time selected intervals. ii) There is no clear shift from a predominant warming to a near stagnation during the most recent period (2001-present). iii) Uniform altitudinal dependence of temperature change trends could not be confirmed for all regions, time intervals and seasons, but sometimes showing an altitude threshold around 3 km. iv) Most of the meteorological stations are associated with MODIS temperature warming pixels, and thus regional cooling is missing when considering only the locations of meteorological stations.

This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) method to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) in the Indian Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements including sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and sea surface salinity anomaly (SSSA). The SVM estimation of STA features the inclusion of in-situ Argo STA data for training and testing. SVM, one of the most popular machine learning methods, can well estimate the STA in the upper 1000 m of the Indian Ocean from satellite measurements of sea surface parameters (SSTA, SSHA and SSSA as input attributes for SVM). The results, based on the common SVM application of Support Vector Regression (SVR), were validated for accuracy and reliability using the Argo STA data. Both MSE and r2 for performance measures are improved after including SSSA for SVR (MSE decreased by 12% and r2 increased by 11% on average). The results showed that SSSA, in addition to SSTA and SSHA, is a useful parameter that can help detect and describe the deeper ocean thermal structure, as well as improve the STA estimation accuracy. Moreover, our method can provide a useful technique for studying subsurface and deeper ocean thermal variability which has played an important role in recent global surface warming hiatus since 1998, from satellite measurements in large basin-wide scale.","Hua Su, Xiangbai Wu, Xiao-Hai Yan, Autumn Kidwell",2015,Remote Sensing of Environment,160,,63?71,01-10-14,28-01-15,10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.001,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715000103,,1,,,En

We confirm from five different global data sets that the global-mean surface temperature trend in the period 1998?2012 is strongly influenced by a pronounced Eurasian winter cooling trend. To understand the drivers of this winter cooling trend, we perform three 20-member ensembles of simulations with different prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice in the atmospheric model ECHAM6. Our experimental results suggest that the Arctic sea ice loss does not drive systematic changes in the Northern Hemisphere large-scale circulation in the past decades. The observed Eurasian winter cooling trend over 1998?2012 arises essentially from atmospheric internal variability and constitutes an extreme climate event. However, the observed reduction in Arctic sea ice enhances the variability of Eurasian winter climate and thus increases the probability of an extreme Eurasian winter cooling trend.","Chao Li, Bjorn Stevens, Jochem Marotzke",2015,GRL,42,19,8131-8139,10-07-15,03-10-15,10.1002/2015GL065327,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL065327/full,,1,,,En

Based on the results confirmed by the multiple data and trend analysis methods, we found that the annual mean temperature in China had a cooling trend during the recent global warming hiatus period, which suggested a robust warming hiatus in China. The warming hiatus in China was dominated by the cooling trend in the cold season, which was mainly induced by the more frequent and enhanced extreme-cold events. By examining the variability of the temperature over different time scales, we found the recent warming hiatus was mainly associated with a downward change of decadal variability, which counteracted the background warming trend. Decadal variability was also much greater in the cold season than in the warm season, and also contributed the most to the previous accelerated warming. We found that the previous accelerated warming and the recent warming hiatus, and the decadal variability of temperature in China were connected to changes in atmospheric circulation. There were opposite circulation changes during these two periods. The westerly winds from the low to the high troposphere over the north of China all enhanced during the previous accelerated warming period, while it weakened during the recent hiatus. The enhanced westerly winds suppressed the invasion of cold air from the Arctic and vice versa. Less frequent atmospheric blocking during the accelerated warming period and more frequent blocking during the recent warming hiatus confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, variation in the Siberian High and East Asian winter monsoon season supports the given conclusions.","Yongkun Xie, Jianping Huang, Yuzhi Liu",2016,International Journal of Climatology,37,4,1758-1773,07-01-16,22-06-16,10.1002/joc.4809,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4809/full,1,1,,,En

However, this study shows that during the recent hiatus in global warming, a striking interhemispheric gradient in Indian Ocean SST trends developed around 2000, with relatively weak or little warming to the north of 10øS and accelerated warming to the south of 10øS. Evidence is presented from a wide variety of data sources showing that this interhemispheric gradient in SST trends is forced primarily by an increase of Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transport from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean induced by stronger Pacific trade winds. This increased transport led to a depression of the thermocline that facilitated SST warming, presumably through a reduction in the vertical turbulent transport of heat in the southern Indian Ocean. Surface wind changes in the Indian Ocean linked to the enhanced Walker circulation also may have contributed to thermocline depth variations and associated SST changes, with downwelling-favorable wind stress curls between 10ø and 20øS and upwelling-favorable wind stress curls between the equator and 10øS. In addition, the anomalous southwesterly wind stresses off the coast of Somalia favored intensified coastal upwelling and offshore advection of upwelled water, which would have led to reduced warming of the northern Indian Ocean. Although highly uncertain, lateral heat advection associated with the ITF and surface heat fluxes may also have played a role in forming the interhemispheric SST gradient change.","Lu Dong, Michael J.

Here we show that a large transformation of modal waters in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) played a crucial role in such contrasting behavior. First, strong winter mixing in 2005 transformed ENA modal waters into a much saltier, warmer, and denser variety, transferring upper ocean heat and salt gained slowly over time to deeper layers. The new denser waters also altered the zonal dynamic height gradient reversing the southward regional flow and enhancing the access of saltier southern waters to higher latitudes.

Single taper and multi-taper spectral analysis from seventeen globally distributed tidal stations and twenty climate proxies show aggregate significant common periodicities in mean sea level fluctuations and the climate proxies of approximately 7 yr, 13 yr, 23 yr, 32 yr, 41 yr, 53 yr, 66 yr, 88 yr, 105 yr and 132 yr, respectively. These periods are shown to strongly correlate with an harmonic sequence of n, m = n + n/4 and p = n + n/2n for n = 5.5 yr and this synchronicity allows for a climate state function to be defined by Lotka?Volterra limit cycles. Such a model can include both anthropogenic warming and complex natural cycles, based on past evidence, and these cycles can form or bifurcate into extreme events close to critical values. The model suggests that accelerating sea levels can be in-phase, but lag decelerating global temperatures or vice versa, so a ?pause? in global warming should not be surprising. Further, the model can simulate the uneven regional effect of climate responses and replicate the chaos apparent in monthly sea-level records. The approach poses ?a planner's dilemma? whereby the likelihood of a present 1 in 100 yr positive extreme event can either be caused by anthropogenic warming within shorter cycles or by a stationary mean in a longer cycle. We simply show that for rising average temperatures in a double period cascading model, there would be a three-fold increase in the likelihood of an equivalent 1 in 100 yr positive extreme event relative to present over a 20 yr period. A consequence to the ?planner's dilemma? is the ?manager's risk imperative? where risk cycles can be quantified into strategic GIS maps of potential future inundations: identifying vulnerability, defining possible economic impacts and underpinning response strategies that are legally defensible and transparent to a range of stakeholders.","R.G.V.

Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8 % decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984?2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (? = 0.991) than the 1942?1984 decline (? = 0.940). Despite great variation in trends between colonies ostensibly linked to differences in predation rates, the recent decline occurred primarily between 1984 and 1996, and thereafter the overall population grew. A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes.","Kyle W. Morrison, Phil F. Battley, Paul M. Sagar, David R.

However, most of these studies are based on instrumental data largely collected from the eastern TP, whereas the temperature trend over the extensive northwestern TP remains uncertain due to few meteorological stations. Here we combined the stable isotopic ë18O record of an ice core recovered in 2012 from the Chongce glacier with the ë18O records of two other ice cores (i.e., Muztagata and Zangser Kangri) in the same region to establish a regional temperature series for the northwestern TP. The reconstruction shows a significant warming trend with a rate of 0.74?ñ?0.12?øC/decade for the period 1970?2000, but a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2012. This is consistent with the reduction of warming rates during the recent decade observed at the only two meteorological stations on the northwestern TP, even though most stations on the eastern TP have shown persistent warming during the same period. Our results suggest a possible recent warming hiatus on the northwestern TP. This could have contributed to the relatively stable status of glaciers in this region.","Wenling An, Shugui Hou, Wangbin Zhang, Shuangye Wu, Hao Xu, Hongxi Pang, Yetang Wang, Yaping Liu",2016,Scientific Reports,6,,32813,06-04-16,09-09-16,10.1038/srep32813,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017263/,1,,,,En

Some of these studies seem to support the idea of internal variability and/or rearrangement of heat between the surface and the ocean interior. Others suggest that radiative forcing might also play a role. Our examination of observational data over the past two decades shows some significant differences when compared to model results from reanalyses and provides the most definitive explanation of how the heat was redistributed. We find that cooling in the top 100-meter layer of the Pacific Ocean was mainly compensated for by warming in the 100- to 300-meter layer of the Indian and Pacific Oceans in the past decade since 2003. ,"Veronica Nieves, Josh K.

On the other hand, spatial variability and nonlinearity in temperature evolution has been recognized as a key point in global change analyses. In this study, we analyse the evolution of the warming rate in the Spanish mainland using the MOTEDAS data set for the last 60?years (1951?2010). Our special emphasis is on the last decades to detect and identify a possible hiatus, and to determine the effects of daytime (Tmax) and night-time (Tmin) records at annual and seasonal scale on the hiatus. Moving windows running trend analyses were applied to calculate temperature trend and significance for any temporal window from the beginning to the end of the series, ranging from 20?years to the whole series length (60?years). The results suggest that the warming rate in the Spanish mainland reached a maximum between 1970 and 1990, followed by a decrease in intensity in both Tmax and Tmin until the present. Furthermore, the decrease in the warming rate in Tmax has been higher than in Tmin for the last three decades; therefore, recent annual warming rates appears to depend more on Tmin than on Tmax. Significant trends disappear from the middle of the 1980s at any temporal window length in both Tmax and Tmin at annual and seasonal scales except in spring Tmin. Some differences among seasons are evident and, during the last few decades, the highest rates of warming are found in spring and summer, with Tmax and Tmin behaving in different ways. This study highlights how the warming rate is highly dependent on the length of the period analysed.","Jos‚ Carlos Gonzalez-Hidalgo, Dhais Pe¤a-Angulo, Michele Brunetti, Nicola Cortesi",2015,International Journal of Climatology,36,6,2405-2416,07-03-15,12-10-15,10.1002/joc.4519,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4519/full,1,,,,En

It is found that significant changes in the RBT frequency occurred earlier, with greater amplitude, for daily minimum temperatures (TN) compared to maximum temperatures (TX) during the past five decades. Changes in the RBT frequency can be mostly explained by the mean warming trend, especially for TN, while in summer also slightly by variance. Moreover, mean climate change affects more the multiday mean RBT than the single-day counterpart as RBT occurrence is inversely proportional to variance that is smaller for multiday means. In the hiatus period (1998?2013), the ratios of record highs to lows in summer continue to increase in southern China primarily due to the lower frequency of record lows, since the decreasing temperature variance suppressed the increase in record highs under the summer warming. While the winter ratios decreased significantly across most of the country due to the winter cooling. Model simulations show a much smaller asymmetry of the RBT frequency between TX and TN as compared to the observations. The 28-model median overestimates the ratios for TX owning to missing the relative cooling in the ?warming hole? region and is unable to reproduce the RBT characteristics in the hiatus period. Under a high-emission scenario, increasing rates of future temperature extremes are projected to accelerate with almost doubling ratio trends in the first half of 21st century compared to the historical results.","Yuanjie Zhang, Zhiqiu Gao, Zaitao Pan, Dan Li, Bingcheng Wan",2016,JGR,121,1,241-258,02-07-15,15-01-16,10.1002/2015JD023886,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JD023886/full,1,,,,En

As a result of its size and height, climate change in the TP has its own unique characteristics that include a proposed positive correlation between the surface temperature and pressure. In this study, we examine the trends and relationships between the surface pressure and temperature in the TP through the examination of monthly mean data from 71 stations during 1961-2013. On annual, seasonal and monthly timescales, the TP exhibits a statistically significant warming trend that attains a rate of 0.30øC/decade for annual means over the period 1961-2013. The most pronounced warming occurs in winter in agreement with previous studies, with evidence of an acceleration in the rate after the mid 1980s and the global warming slowdown period. For the entire period 1961-2013, the surface pressure in the TP has a positive trend of 0.08 hPa/decade on an annual basis, again with the largest trends occurring in winter. However unlike what occurred with the surface temperature, the trend in surface pressure, in most cases, reversed sign after the mid 1980s. The trend in the geopotential height at 500 hPa from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis is consistent with the observed surface pressure trends. Over the period 1961-2013, there is a seasonal shift in the nature of the relationship between the surface temperature and pressure with a negative correlation during the summer and autumn, and a positive correlation during the winter. This suggests that the nature of the relationship between these two climate elements reflects the changing nature of the seasonal snow cover (land surface property) and cloud in the region.","Qinglong You, Zhihong Jiang, G.W.K.

But the mechanisms responsible for the widening remain unclear, and the widening in simulations is generally smaller than observed. To identify mechanisms responsible for the HC widening and for model?observation discrepancies, this study analyzes how interannual variations of tropical-mean temperatures and meridional temperature gradients influence the HC width. Changes in mean temperatures are part of any global warming signal, whereas changes in temperature gradients are primarily associated with ENSO. Within this study, 6 reanalysis datasets, 22 Atmospheric Modeling Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations, and 11 historical simulations from phase 5 of the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are analyzed, covering the years 1979?2012. It is found that the HC widens as mean temperatures increase or as temperature gradients weaken in most reanalyses and climate models. On average, climate models exhibit a smaller sensitivity of HC width to changes in mean temperatures and temperature gradients than do reanalyses. However, the sensitivities differ substantially among reanalyses, rendering the HC response to mean temperatures in climate models not statistically different from that in reanalyses. While global-mean temperatures did not increase substantially between 1997 and 2012, the HC continued to widen in most reanalyses. The analysis here suggests that the HC widening from 1979 to 1997 is primarily the result of global warming, whereas the widening of the HC from 1997 to 2012 is associated with increased midlatitude temperatures and hence reduced temperature gradients during this period.","Ori Adam, Tapio Schneider, Nili Harnik",2014,Journal of Climate,27,19,7450?7461,21-02-14,xx.10.2014,10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00140.1,http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00140.1,,,1,,En

Our results show that the coldest 5% of minimum temperature anomalies (the coldest deviation) have increased monotonically by 0.22?øC/decade, which reflects well the elevated anthropogenic GHG effect. The warmest 5% of maximum temperature anomalies (the warmest deviation), however, display a significant oscillation following the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), with a warming rate of 0.07?øC/decade from 1900 to 2013. The warmest (0.34?øC/decade) and coldest deviations (0.25?øC/decade) increased at much higher rates over the most recent decade than last century mean values, indicating the hiatus should not be interpreted as a general slowing of climate change.

The used scale does not necessarily correspond to the intrinsic scales of the natural temperature variability. This scale mismatch complicates the separation of externally forced temperature trends from natural temperature fluctuations. The hiatus of global warming since 1999 has been claimed to show that human activities play only a minor role in global warming. Most likely this claim is wrong due to the inadequate consideration of the scale-dependency in the global surface temperature (GST) evolution. Here we show that the variability and trend of the global mean surface temperature anomalies (GSTA) from January 1850 to December 2013, which incorporate both land and sea surface data, is scale-dependent and that the recent hiatus of global warming is mainly related to natural long-term oscillations. These results provide a possible explanation of the recent hiatus of global warming and suggest that the hiatus is only temporary.","Yong Lin, Christian L. E.

These precipitation shifts are most easily detected during March-May season when ENSO effects are weak. Analyses have linked this climate shift to a shift in the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) pattern to its negative phase. Here we evaluate the predictive skill of the North American Multi-model Ensemble (NMME), and the CFSv2 model alone, in maintaining the observed precipitation shifts in seasonal forecasts, emphasizing the southwestern US where deficient precipitation has tended to prevail since late 1990s. The NMME hindcasts out to 6 months lead are found to maintain the observed decadal precipitation shifts in key locations qualitatively correctly, but with increasingly underestimated amplitude with increasing lead time. This finding holds in the separate CFSv2 model hindcasts. The decadal precipitation shift is relatively well reproduced in the southwestern US. The general underestimation of the precipitation shift is suggested to be related to a muted reproduction of the observed shift in Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). This conclusion is supported by runs from a different (but overlapping) set of atmospheric models, which when forced with observed SST reproduce the decadal shifts quite well. Overall, the capability of the NMME model hindcasts to reflect the observed decadal rainfall pattern shift, but with weakened amplitude (especially at longer leads), underscores the broader challenge of retaining decadal signals in predictions of drought and pluvials at seasonal to interannual time scales.","Anthony G.

Observed trends in WBGT (1973?2012) are compared to trends from CMIP5 historical simulations (eight-model ensemble) using either anthropogenic and natural forcing agents combined or natural forcings alone. Our analysis suggests that there has been a detectable anthropogenic increase in mean summertime heat stress since 1973, both globally and in most land regions analyzed. A detectable increase is found over a larger fraction of land for WBGT than for temperature, as WBGT summertime means have lower interannual variability than surface temperature at gridbox scales. Notably, summertime WBGT over land has continued increasing in recent years--consistent with climate models--despite the apparent ?hiatus? in global warming and despite a decreasing tendency in observed relative humidity over land since the late 1990s.","Thomas R.

Both the observed timing and magnitude of the IO decadal variations are well reproduced in those experiments with the TEP SSTs prescribed to observations. Although the external forcings account for most of the warming trend, the decadal variability in IO SSTs is dominated by internal variability that is induced by the TEP SSTs, especially the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). The IPO weakens (enhances) the warming of the external forcings by about 50% over the IO during IPO?s cold (warm) phase, which contributes about 10% to the recent global warming hiatus since 1999.

Given this finding, we are interested in diagnosing trends in the Earth?s outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) spectrum throughout the last decade. Methods: We calculated the trend in OLR measured by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA?s Aqua satellite between 2003 and 2013, and compared these results with the trend in atmospheric and surface temperature and tropospheric absolute humidity, obtained from AIRS retrieval product and from the ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting) Re-Analysis (ERA) interim product. We also isolated the greenhouse effect from the OLR trend by subtracting the amount of surface radiation emitted from the total radiation received by the sounder. Results: The OLR trend is negative in the CO2 absorption band, negative in the window spectral region, and positive in the water vapor band. The trend in surface and tropospheric temperature is negative, as is the trend in tropospheric absolute humidity. The greenhouse effect is increasing in the CO2 band, generally slightly increasing in the window region, and decreasing in the H2O band. Conclusion: Our results show that the CO2 forcing was still present globally through the last decade, with steadily increasing effects. Contributors to the negative trend in OLR in the window region are a small decrease in surface temperature and a strong decrease in tropospheric temperature, where tropospheric H2O emit radiation to space. The decreasing effect of water vapor in the H2O band is due to decreasing tropospheric humidity. This analysis will allow us to detect the changes in greenhouse gas forcing, to examine the correlated surface temperature response, and to study changes and effects in tropospheric water vapor concentration.","Jeanne Blanchette, Yi Huang",2015,McGill Science Undergraduate Research Journal,10,1,14-17,17-09-14,06-03-15,,http://msurj.mcgill.ca/vol10/iss1/MSURJ2015.pdf#page=14,,1,,,En

Comparing two periods before and after the mid-2000s indicates that intense typhoons rarely occurred over the PS in September before the mid-2000s, with a frequency of fewer than 0.4 per year, but reached up to nearly 1.5 per year after the mid-2000s. The abrupt increase in intense typhoon occurrences over the PS was primarily attributed to increased tropical cyclone (TC) genesis and favorable large-scale conditions for TC intensification. The increase in TC genesis number over the PS was caused by contributory dynamical conditions, including positive low-level relative vorticity anomalies and anomalous ascents, which corresponded to a southwestward shift and strengthening of the monsoon trough. In addition, among the favorable large-scale conditions, the increased relative humidity that resulted from intensified moisture flux convergence exerted essential effect on the TC intensification. These changes in atmospheric environmental conditions favoring intense typhoon occurrences over the PS were primarily associated with the change in the tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) around the mid-2000s. Besides that, the positive feedback TCs exerted on the circulation was also conducive to the unusual growth in intense typhoon occurrences over the PS.

Although several explanations have been proposed for the warming-trend slowdown (WTS), none has been generally accepted. We investigate the WTS using a recently developed methodology that can successfully identify and separate the dynamically induced and radiatively forced SAT changes from raw SAT data. The dynamically induced SAT changes exhibited an obvious cooling effect relative to the warming effect of the adjusted SAT in the hiatus process. A correlation analysis suggests that the changes are dominated primarily by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Our results confirm that dynamically induced variability caused the WTS. The radiatively forced SAT changes are determined mainly by anthropogenic forcing, indicating the warming influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which reached levels of 400?ppm during the hiatus period. Therefore, the global SAT will not remain permanently neutral. The increased radiatively forced SAT will be amplified by increased dynamically induced SAT when the natural mode returns to a warming phase in the next period.","Xiaodan Guan, Jianping Huang, Ruixia Guo, Pu Lin",2015,Scientific Reports,5,,12669,11-11-14,30-07-15,10.1038/srep12669,http://www.nature.com/articles/srep12669,,1,,,En

However, the rapidly developing drought events that are termed as ?flash droughts? accompanied by extreme heat, low soil moisture and high evapotranspiration (ET), occurred frequently around the world, and caused devastating impacts on crop yields and water supply. Here, we investigate the long-term trend and variability of flash droughts over China. Flash droughts are most likely to occur over humid and semi-humid regions, such as southern and northeastern China. Flash drought averaged over China increased by 109% from 1979 to 2010, and the increase was mainly due to a long term warming of temperature (50%), followed by the contributions from decreasing soil moisture and increasing ET. There was a slight drop in temperature after 1997, but the increasing trend of flash droughts was tripled. Further results indicate that the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced ET, leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus. The anthropogenic warming in the next few decades may exacerbate future flash drought conditions in China.","Linying Wang, Xing Yuan, Zhenghui Xie, Peili Wu, Yaohui Li",2016,Scientific Reports,6,,30571,01-04-16,11-08-16,10.1038/srep30571,http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30571,,,1,,En

The five data sets included three reconstructed data sets of surface temperature observations and two data sets derived using the satellite microwave sounding unit retrieval products in the lower troposphere (LT) for the period from January 1980 to December 2014. Unlike previous studies, the current study shows that the warming trends significantly decreased over both the land and ocean since 1992 and reached their minimum (near zero) in the early 2000s, which is consistent with the occurrence of the warming hiatus. However, due to the sharp decrease in the surface warming trend over the land (1992 to 2007) in conjunction with an increase in the ocean surface warming trend after 2002, the combined trend carries an overall positive sign (between 2005 and 2007) due to the greater ocean warming trend. The rate of warming increase in the ocean, which began in 2002, is surprisingly fast and is approaching the highest warming trends observed over the land since 1980. These basic land and ocean trend results are confirmed by all five data sets with slightly different values due to the various techniques used in compiling the data sets.

One contributory factor to this ?warming hiatus? is an increase in volcanically induced cooling over the early 21st century. Here we identify the signals of late 20th and early 21st century volcanic activity in multiple observed climate variables. Volcanic signals are statistically discernible in spatial averages of tropical and near-global SST, tropospheric temperature, net clear-sky short-wave radiation, and atmospheric water vapor. Signals of late 20th and early 21st century volcanic eruptions are also detectable in near-global averages of rainfall.

We here examine zonal mean temperature trends in satellite-based tropospheric data sets (based on data from (Advanced) Microwave Sounding Unit and Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation instruments) and in global surface temperatures (HadCRUT4). Omission of successively larger polar regions from the global mean temperature calculations, in both tropospheric and surface data sets, shows that data gaps at high latitudes cannot explain the observed differences between the hiatus and the prehiatus period.

Some recent studies have suggested that the hiatus in global warming is possibly due to strong cooling in the tropical Pacific. This study investigates the possible role of the Indian Ocean warming on the tropical Pacific cooling. Despite the continued rise in sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical Indian Ocean, SST over the tropical Pacific has shown a cooling trend in the recent decade (2002 ? 2012). It is well known fact that the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are strongly coupled to each other and the Indian Ocean basin wide warming is triggered by El Ni¤o on interannual time scale. However, in the recent decade, this relationship is weakening. The recent Indian Ocean warming is triggering a Matsuno-Gill type response in the atmosphere by generating anomalous cyclonic circulations on either side of equator over the tropical Indian Ocean and anomalous easterlies along the tropical Pacific Ocean. These anomalous easterlies result in Ekman divergence in the equatorial Pacific and produce upwelling Kelvin waves, cools the tropical Pacific and therefore indirectly contributes to the hiatus in global warming.","Anika Arora, Suryachandra A.

Most studies have focused on the interpretation underlying this temperature change. In this study, changes in the global aridity index (AI) were analyzed using a newly developed dynamical adjustment method that can successfully identify and separate dynamically induced and radiatively-forced aridity changes in the raw data. The AI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) appeared a wetting zone over the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades. The dynamical adjustment analysis suggests that this wetting zone occurred in response to the global warming hiatus. The dynamically-induced AI (DAI) played a major role in the AI changes during the hiatus period, and its relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) also indicate that different phases of the NAO, PDO, and AMO contributed to different performance of the DAI over the Northern Hemisphere. Although the aridity wetting over the mid-to-high latitudes may relieve long-term drying in certain regions, the hiatus is temporary, and so is the relief. Accelerated global warming will return when the NAO, PDO, and AMO revert to their opposite phases in the future, and the wetting zone is likely to disappear.","Xiaodan Guan, Jianping Huang, Ruixia Guo",2016,Journal of Meteorological Research,31,,117-125,21-04-16,23-09-16,10.1007/s13351-017-6038-1,http://www.cmsjournal.net:8080/Jweb_jmr/CN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=1703,,,1,1,En

Some authors have attributed the ?warming hiatus? to the internal changes in the climate system, i.e., the recombination of ocean-atmosphere circulations. Therefore, it is necessary to propose higher requirements on reconstructing circulation background of climate change for the past millennium. However, the analyses of changes in atmospheric circulation over the last millennium as well as the conclusions of related regional climate patterns are so widely different and contradictory, bringing uncertainties to our understanding of regional even global climate change to a great extent. On the other hand, in the last 10 years the high-precision U/Th-dated stalagmite oxygen isotope ratio (ë18O) sequences provided an accurate chronological frame for the paleoclimate study of the middle and late Pleistocene, in which all authors from China took the Chinese stalagmite ë18O as the summer monsoon index without exception. However, this point of view misleads the climate scientists into thinking that the stalagmite ë18O can be as the proxy of precipitation amount. Nevertheless, it is well known that all of these records have a lot in common in the low frequency trend. However, most sequences cannot be calibrated by instrumental precipitation records, and thus the uncertainty of the climate research framework of China and even of the world has increased. Therefore, it is imperative for climatology to clarify the origin of contradiction and to reduce the uncertainty as early as possible. On the basis of analyzing the significance of stalagmite ë18O in the monsoon regions of China, the author tries to propose a new circulation proxy in this paper: integrating the Chinese stalagmite oxygen isotope sequence to reconstruct the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature gradient, i.e., the large-scale ENSO-like state over the past millennium. Furthermore, the author speculates that it was warm in the modern times and the Medieval Period, but the circulation recombination was different in both periods. And this inference could be supported by the longer record since Last Glacial Maximum. In other words, the attribution analysis of the identical low-frequency trends of Chinese stalagmite ë18O on a large scale shows that the ENSO-like state controls the climate change in the monsoon regions of China at different time scales (from interannual to century or even longer time scales). Wherein the important connection of circulations is the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), that is to say, besides the interannual and decadal time scales, the WPSH would possess the circulation mode on longer timescales. For example, we may discuss the change of the WPSH in the whole Holocene epoch, i.e., the half precession period. These discussions could make sense to the study of not only the paleoclimate but also the modern climate.",Ming Tan,2016,Science China Earth Sciences,59,6,1225-1241,24-12-15,18-03-16,10.1007/s11430-015-5256-6,http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11430-015-5256-6,1,1,,,En

This leads to a question: where is the extra heat going? Using four in situ observation datasets, we explore the ocean subsurface temperature changes from 2004 to 2013. The observations all show that the ocean has continued to gain heat in this century, which is indicative of anthropogenic global warming. However, a distinctive pattern of change in the interior ocean is observed. The sea surface (1?100?m) temperature has decreased in this century, accompanied by warming in the 101?300?m layer. This pattern is due to the changes in the frequency of El Ni¤o and La Ni¤a events (ENSO characteristics), according to both observations and CMIP5 model simulations. In addition, we show for the first time that the ocean subsurface within 301?700?m experienced a net cooling, indicative of another instance of variability in the natural ocean.

Does plant phenology ? which is believed to be a suitable indicator of climate change ? respond in a similar way, that is, does it still mirror recent temperature variations? We explored in detail long-term flowering onset dates of snowdrop, cherry, and lime tree and relevant spring temperatures at three sites in Germany (1901?2012) using the Bayesian multiple change-point approach. We investigated whether mean spring temperature changes were amplified or slowed down in the past decade and how plant phenology responded to the most recent temperature changes. Incorporating records with different end points (i.e., 2002 and 2012), we compared differences in trends and inferred possible differences caused by extrapolating phenological and meteorological data. The new multiple-change point approach is characterized by an enhanced structure and greater flexibility compared to the one change point model. However, the highest model probabilities for phenological (meteorological) records were still obtained for the one change point (linear) model. Marked warming trends in the recent decade were only revealed for mean temperatures of March to May, here better described with one or two change point models. In the majority of cases analyzed, changes in temperatures were well mirrored by phenological changes. However, temperatures in March to May were linked to less strongly advancing onset dates for lime tree flowering during the period 1901-2012, pointing to the likely influence of photoperiodic constraints or unfulfilled chilling requirements. Due to the slowdown of temperature increase, analyses conducted on records ending in 2002 demonstrated distinct differences when compared with records ending in 2012. Extrapolation of trends could therefore (along with the choice of the statistical method) lead to distinctly different results and most recent data should be integrated in order not to over- or underestimate future phenological changes.","Susanne Jochner, Annette Menzel",2015,Ecology and Evolution,5,11,2284-2295,22-10-14,15-05-15,10.1002/ece3.1503,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1503/full,,,1,,En

In this study, we applied piecewise linear regression to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the breakpoint time of warming over 40 years (1974?2013). Our results showed that at the global scale, mean annual temperature (MAT) over the land increased significantly until 2005 and that the warming trend then stalled. However, the breakpoint time of the warming varied greatly among different seasons and continents. We found no statistically significant breakpoint in MAT over the Northern Hemisphere, but MAT over the Southern Hemisphere showed a significant breakpoint (P < 0.001) in 1979. At the seasonal scale, only the winter season (Dec?Jan?Feb) showed a statistically significant breakpoint in global land temperature. The other seasons showed continuous increasing temperature during the whole study period. Our study examined the recent global warming hiatus on the land surface using an area-weighted summary of a scale-dependent phenomenon with substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and revealed the winter cooling in the Northern Hemisphere low-mid latitudes in 1999-2008 as the major contributor to the global warming hiatus on land surface in 2005. This result highlights the importance of using a statistical method to identify the timing of climate phase change.

Here the sensitivity of aerosol-cloud albedo effect forcing to 31 aerosol parameters is quantified. Sensitivities are compared over three periods; 1850?2008, 1978?2008, and 1998?2008. Despite declining global anthropogenic SO2 emissions during 1978?2008, a cancelation of regional positive and negative forcings leads to a near-zero global mean cloud albedo effect forcing. In contrast to existing negative estimates, our results suggest that the aerosol-cloud albedo effect was likely positive (0.006 to 0.028Wm?2) in the recent decade, making it harder to explain the temperature hiatus as a forced response. Proportional contributions to forcing variance from aerosol processes and natural and anthropogenic emissions are found to be period dependent.

Period (2001?2010),"An assessment is made of the mean and variability of the net air-sea heat flux, Qnet, from four products (ECCO, OAFlux/CERES, ERA-Interim and NCEP1: acronyms defined in the introduction) over the global ice-free oceans from January 2001 to December 2010. For the 10-year ?hiatus? period, all products agree on an overall net heat gain over the global ice-free ocean, but the magnitude varies from 1.7 to 9.5 Wm?2. The differences among products are particularly large in the Southern Ocean, where they cannot even agree on whether the region gains or loses heat on the annual mean basis. Decadal trends of Qnet differ significantly between products. ECCO and OAFlux/CERES show almost no trend, whereas ERA-Interim suggests a downward trend and NCEP1 shows an upward trend. Therefore, numerical simulations utilizing different surface flux forcing products will likely produce diverged trends of the ocean heat content during this period. The downward trend in ERA-Interim started from 2006, driven by a peculiar pattern change in the tropical regions. ECCO, which used ERA-Interim as initial surface forcings and is constrained by ocean dynamics and ocean observations, corrected the pattern. Among the four products, ECCO and OAFlux/CERES show great similarities in the examined spatial and temporal patterns. Given that the two estimates were obtained using different approaches and based on largely independent observations, these similarities are encouraging and instructive. It is more likely that the global net air-sea heat flux does not change much during the ?hiatus? period.","Xinfeng Liang, Lisan Yu",2016,Journal of Climate,29,10,3647-3660,02-09-15,02-03-16,10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0626.1,http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0626.1,1,,,,En

The monotonically increasing trend of the KI index extracted by empirical mode decomposition implies a slight decreasing trend of the meridional pressure gradient across the Luzon Strait, suggesting a weakening of the KI into the SCS based on the geostrophy. This weakening is largely due to an intensification of the upstream Kuroshio east of Luzon, which is closely correlated with the latitude of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) bifurcation off the Philippines. We also find that the latitude of the NEC bifurcation has tended to migrate southward in recent years, coincident with the strengthening of the Kuroshio east of Luzon. The forcing of the trends of low-latitude circulation is attributable to changing surface wind fields in the tropical Pacific. The trade winds have intensified in response to the recent global warming hiatus, and an anomalous cyclonic wind field has appeared over the Philippine Sea. Both of these phenomena have contributed to the southward migration of the NEC bifurcation latitude in recent years. This has led to enhance the Kuroshio transport east of Luzon, and the Kuroshio has tended to bypass the Luzon Strait without significant westward encroachment.","Chau-Ron Wu, You-Lin Wang, Yong-Fu Lin, Tzu-Ling Chiang, Chao-Chi Wu",2016,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,9,11,5064-5070,,10-08-16,10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2574941 ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7539685/,,,1,,En

While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1å model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO.","Mathias Vuille, Eric Franquist, Ren‚ Garreaud, Waldo Sven Lavado Casimiro, Bolivar C ceres",2015,JGR,120,9,3745-3757,16-01-15,15-04-15,10.1002/2015JD023126,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JD023126/full,,,1,,En

Corresponding in time to the onset of this regime shift, the climate state transitioned into a combined La Ni¤a and negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which incited a hiatus in global warming in the 2000s (Kosaka and Xie, 2013; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2013). Superimposed upon a long-term regional drying trend, synergistic interactions between these teleconnection modes triggered the establishment of a devastating and prolonged drought, which engulfed the Fertile Crescent, namely Iraq and Syria, and led to crop failure and civil unrest [Kelley et al., 2015]. Dried soils and diminished vegetation cover in the Fertile Crescent, as evident through remotely-sensed Enhanced Vegetation Indices, supported greater dust generation and transport to the Arabian Peninsula in 2007?2013, as identified both in increased dust days observed at weather stations and enhanced remotely-sensed aerosol optical depth. According to backward trajectory analysis of dust days on the Arabian Peninsula, increased dust lifting and atmospheric dust concentration in the Fertile Crescent during this recent, prolonged drought episode supported a greater frequency of dust events across the peninsula with associated northerly trajectories and led to the dust regime shift.

We hypothesized that the interdecadal changes linearly consisted of two independent components, anthropogenic forcing and natural decadal variability, which can be represented simply by the radiative forcing effect of carbon dioxide (RF CO 2  ) (RFCO2) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), respectively. The combined effect of the RF CO 2   RFCO2 and PDO could explain the majority of the surface temperature changes during the late 1970s and 1990s, but the magnitudes of the relative contribution of the RF CO 2 RFCO2 and the PDO are inconsistent in different regions. For both the surface temperature and geopotential height, the RF CO 2 RFCO2 could induce significantly positive anomalies over almost the entire globe for these two shifts, exhibiting a larger magnitude in the mid?high latitudes and in the late 1990s shift. The PDO could induce opposite anomalies for the two interdecadal shifts due to its phase transitions (negative-positive?negative). Furthermore, for the shift in the late 1970s, both the RF CO 2 RFCO2 (53.7 %?66.7 %) and the PDO (33.3 %?46.3 %) were important in regulating the tropical geopotential height, whereas the RF CO 2 RFCO2 dominated the changes in the mid-latitudes.

Meanwhile, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, an internally generated mode of climate variability4, transitioned from positive to negative5, with an average cooling of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures5, a slowdown of the global warming trend6, 7, 8 and a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low near Antarctica1, 9, 10, 11, 12 that has contributed to regional circulation changes in the Ross Sea region and expansion of sea ice10. Here we show that the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in global coupled climate models is characterized by anomalies similar to the observed sea-level pressure and near-surface 850?hPa wind changes near Antarctica since 2000 that are conducive to expanding Antarctic sea-ice extent, particularly in the Ross Sea region in all seasons, involving a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low. These atmospheric circulation changes are shown to be mainly driven by precipitation and convective heating anomalies related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in the equatorial eastern Pacific, with additional contributions from convective heating anomalies in the South Pacific convergence zone and tropical Atlantic regions.","Gerald A.

Here we present the time evolution of the global ocean heat content for 1958 through 2009 from a new observation-based reanalysis of the ocean. Volcanic eruptions and El Ni¤o events are identified as sharp cooling events punctuating a long-term ocean warming trend, while heating continues during the recent upper-ocean-warming hiatus, but the heat is absorbed in the deeper ocean. In the last decade, about 30% of the warming has occurred below 700 m, contributing significantly to an acceleration of the warming trend. The warming below 700 m remains even when the Argo observing system is withdrawn although the trends are reduced.

This study reveals a close connection (R = 0.5) between the extratropical sea surface temperature (ET-SST) and ASIC in winter from 1994 to 2013. In response to one positive (negative) unit of deviation in the ET-SST pattern, the ASIC decreases (increases) in the Barents?Kara Seas and Hudson Bay (the Baffin Bay and Bering Sea) by 100?400 km2. This relationship might be maintained due to the impact of warming extratropical oceans on the polar vortex. Positive SST anomalies in the mid-latitudes of the North Pacific and Atlantic (around 40øN) strengthen the equatorward planetary wave propagation, whereas negative SST anomalies in high latitudes weaken the upward planetary wave propagation from the lower troposphere to the stratosphere. The former indicates a strengthening of the poleward meridional eddy momentum flux, and the latter implies a weakening of the poleward eddy heat flux, which favors an intensified upper-level polar night jet and a colder polar vortex, implying a stronger-than-normal polar vortex. Consequently, an anomalous cyclone emerges over the eastern Arctic, limiting/encouraging the ASIC by modulating the mean meridional heat flux. A possible reason for the long-term changes in the relationship between the ET-SST and ASIC is also discussed.","Fei Li, Huijun Wang, Yongqi Gao",2015,Journal of Climate,28,14,5510-5522,11-09-14,13-07-15,10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00629.1,http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00629.1,1,,,,En

In this study, both analytical derivations and numerical analyses demonstrate that IADM provides no additional information to that of the conventional linear regression, and also, it may give a false indication of dependence. For clarity and simplicity, we therefore recommend linear regression analysis over the IADM for the detection of dependence. We also find that heavy precipitation decreased during the global warming hiatus, and the precipitation dependence on temperature drops by almost 50% when the study period is extended to 1979?2014 and it may keep dropping in the near future.

During 1961?2005, the mean temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the whole TP show a statistically increasing trend especially after the 1980s, with the annual rates of 0.27, 0.19 and 0.36 øC decade?1, respectively. The performance of 26 general circulation models (GCMs) available in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is evaluated in the TP by comparison with the observations during 1961?2005. Most CMIP5 GCMs can capture the decadal variations of the observed mean temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature, and have significant positive correlations with observations (R?>?0.5), with root mean squared error <1 øC. This suggests that CMIP5 GCMs can reproduce the recent temperature evolution in the TP, but with cold biases. However, most CMIP5 GCMs underestimate the observed warming rates, especially the CNRM-CM5, GISS-E2-H and MRI-CGCM3 models. There are significant positive correlations between the trend magnitudes and the anomaly of the mean temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature, with correlations of 0.85, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. The warming from the observations and CMIP5 mean in the TP is significant during the global hiatus period, consistent with decreasing snow cover and albedo in the region.

Here we diagnose the GMSL budget for ENSO events observationally using data from profiling floats, satellite gravimetry, and radar altimetry during 2005?2015. Steric and barystatic effects make comparable contributions to the GMSL budget during ENSO, in contrast to previous interpretations based largely on hydrological models, which emphasize the barystatic component. The steric contributions reflect changes in global ocean heat content, centered on the Pacific. Distributions of ocean heat storage in the Pacific arise from a mix of diabatic and adiabatic effects.

Warming trends of approximately View the MathML source0.03øCyr?1 were observed in the upper 2000 m of the water column. A strong annual temperature cycle exists and dominates at the 500 m depth, while signals at the interannual timescales can explain most of the temperature variability at the 1000 m and 1500 m depths. These interannual signals are closely correlated to the variability of deep convection in the Labrador Sea, which has intermittent enhancement of mixed layer depth (MLD)>1500 m. The Hilbert spectrum from the OHC in the Labrador Sea interior reveals two important components at frequencies of View the MathML source0.8~1.2cycleyr?1 (T  =0.8~1.25 years) and View the MathML source0.1~0.3cycleyr?1 (T=3.3~10 years), respectively, superimposed on the warming trends. The former corresponds to the dominant seasonal cycle due to surface heating, while the latter is concomitant with the timing of the reoccurrence of convective events. We also found that the cumulative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index significantly correlates to the low-frequency OHC variations. Therefore, the interannual signals in the Labrador Sea at especially the intermediate layers are attributed to changes in the deep convective processes and the atmospheric conditions. By comparing with an extended OHC record (1945?2010), it was further shown that the warming trends obtained from the 10-year Argo record are part of multi-decadal variations that presumably reflect the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). In addition, the recent OHC changes in the Labrador Sea (i.e., increased heat in the deeper layers) may be related to the current global warming hiatus, suggesting the potential contributions from the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to the low-frequency OHC in the Labrador Sea.","Feili Li, Young-Heon Jo, Xiao-Hai Yan, W.

Crucial aspects in this argument are the reliability of the wind signal, usually derived from atmospheric reanalyses, and the ability of models to represent it. This study addresses these two aspects by comparing various observations with reanalyses and model integrations from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system. We show that the strengthening of trades over the Pacific is a robust feature in several observational data sets as well as in the reanalyses based on full and limited sets of observations.

The Indian Ocean wind variability associated with the IOD to a certain extent offset the Pacific ENSO influences on the ITF geostrophic transport during the developing and mature phases of El Ni¤o and La Ni¤a, due to the covarying IOD variability with ENSO. The ITF geostrophic transport experiences a strengthening trend of about 1 Sv every 10 years over the study period, which is mostly due to a response to the strengthening of the trade winds in the Pacific during the climate change hiatus period.

The Atlantic warming drives easterly wind anomalies over the Indo-western Pacific as Kelvin waves and westerly anomalies over the eastern Pacific as Rossby waves. The wind changes induce an Indo-western Pacific warming through the wind?evaporation?SST effect6, 7, and this warming intensifies the La Ni¤a-type response in the tropical Pacific by enhancing the easterly trade winds and through the Bjerknes ocean dynamical processes8. The teleconnection develops into a tropical-wide SST dipole pattern.

Sea level variations in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) are dominated by the annual cycle and the long-term increasing trend. In comparison, the SSHA along the Gulf Stream (GS) is dominated by variability at intraseasonal and annual time scales. Moreover, the sea level rise in the SPG developed at a reduced rate in the 2000s compared to rates in the 1990s, which was accompanied by a rebound in SSHA variability following a period of lower variability in the system. These changes in both apparent trend and low-frequency SSHA oscillations reveal the importance of low-frequency variability in the SPG. To identify the possible contributing factors for these changes, the heat content balance (equivalent variations in the sea level) in the subpolar region was examined. The results indicate that horizontal circulations may primarily contribute to the interannual to decadal variations, while the air?sea heat flux is not negligible at annual time scale.

Changes in annual maximum snowline during 1985 - 2015 and also the decadal changes in the area between 1975 and 2015 of these glaciers were calculated. Furthermore, we analysed the rate of glacier retreat during the occurrence of El Ni¤o?Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. It is observed that the glaciers in both the inner and outer tropics underwent retreat during the study period and most of this retreat occurred during 1975 - 1997 which is parallel with the so-called Pacific shift.

It is found that in most stations linear trends of Tmax and Tmin are generally stronger in winter than in summer, and warming trend of the 5th percentile temperature (cold extreme) is stronger than that of the 95th percentile temperature (warm extreme) in both seasons. The nonlinear trends, which are evaluated by the second order polynomial fitting, show a strong nonlinearity in winter. Specifically, winter temperatures have increased until 2000s but slightly decreased afterward in all percentiles. This contrasts with the 95th and 50th percentiles of summer Tmin that show a decreasing trend until 1980s then an increasing trend. While this result is consistent with a seasonal dependence of the recent global warming hiatus, most of the nonlinear trends are statistically insignificant, making a quantitative attribution of nonlinear temperature trends challenging.","???, ???, ???, ???, C.

During the accelerated global warming periods (1980s and 1990s), SST over offshore China shows faster rising trend than the global mean. The most pronounced warming area is located over the East China Sea, with the rising rate up to 0.60? per decade, which is 5 times faster than that of the global mean. While during the hiatus period (1998-2014), SST over offshore China exhibits significant cooling trend. The decadal variability of offshore China SST is closely linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

This paper summarizes the current research results of global warming slowdown at home and abroad. Most scientists recognize the fact that global warming is stagnant over the past decade and that solar activity is at a low level, atmospheric aerosols (natural and man-made) increases and ocean heat is a potential contributor to warming stagnation, in which the ocean (especially 700 Rice below the deep sea) the storage of heat may be the key to warming stagnation. The model in Phase 5 of the International Coupled Mode Comparison Program does not accurately describe the near-term phase evolution of various favorable cooling effects factors, and its recent warming trend is stronger than the observation. It is concluded that the warming stagnation is mainly caused by natural factors, and the predicted warming will slow down in recent years or decades (depending on the Pacific interdecadal oscillation phase shift), the future temperature will still be mainly by greenhouse gases Increase the impact and show a clear upward trend. As a result, the current slowdown in global warming is unlikely to change the risk of global warming by the end of the century. This review looks at future research hotspots that include the precise transformation of the global air temperature and ocean heat content variability and its uncertainty, the transgender signals of the oceanic interdecadal signals (Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal oscillations), and the heat stored in the deep sea When to return to the ocean surface and its potential impact on regional climate.","Jingzhi Su, Min Wen, Yihui Ding, Yongqi Gao, Yafang Song",2016,Chinese Journal of Atmospheric Sciences,40,6,1143-1153,,,10.3878/j.issn.1006-9895.1512.15242,http://www.dqkxqk.ac.cn/dqkx/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20160604&flag=1&journal_id=dqkx,,,,,Ch

(Climate change science and sustainable development),"Since the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007, new observations have further proved that the warming of the global climate system is unequivocal. Each of the last three successive decades before 2012 has been successively warmer at global mean surface temperature than any preceding decade since 1850. 1983-2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years. From 1998 to 2012, the rate of warming of the global land surface slowed down, but it did not reflect the long-term trends in climate change. The ocean has warmed, and the upper 75 m of the ocean warmed by more than 0.11? per decade since 1970. Over the period of 1971 to 2010, 93% of the net energy increase in the Earth's climate system was stored in the oceans. The rate of global mean sea level rise has accelerated, which was up to 3.2 mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2010. Anthropogenic global ocean carbon stocks were likely to have increased and caused acidification of the ocean surface water. Since 1971, the glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass. Since 1979, the Arctic sea ice extent deceased at 3.5% to 4.1% per decade, and the Antarctic sea ice extent in the same period increased by 1.2% to 1.8% per decade. The extent of the Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased. Since the early 1980s, the permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions. Human influence has been detected in the warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, changes in the water cycle, reductions in snow and ice, global mean sea level rise, and changes in climate extremes. The largest contribution to the increase in the anthropogenic radiative forcing was by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 since 1750. It led to more than half of global warming since the 1950s (with 95 % confidence). It is predicted using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that the global mean surface temperature will continue to rise for the end of this century, the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves and heavy precipitation will increase, and precipitation will present a trend of ""the dry becomes drier, the wet becomes wetter"". The temperature of the upper ocean will increase by 0.6 to 2.0? compared to the period of 1986 to 2005, heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean which will affect ocean circulation, and sea level will rise by 0.26 to 0.82 m in 2100. Cryosphere will continue to warm. To control global warming, humans need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. If the increase in temperature is higher than 2? than before industrialization, the mean annual economic losses worldwide will reach 0.2% to 2.0% of income, and cause large-scale irreversible effects, including death, disease, food insecurity, inland flooding and water logging, and rural drinking water and irrigation difficulties that affect human security. If taking prompt actions, however, it is still possible to limit the increase in temperature within 2?. To curb the gradually out-of-control global warming and achieve the goal of sustainable development of the human society, global efforts to reduce emissions are needed.",Dahe Qin,2014,Progress in Geography,33,7,874-883,,,10.11820/dlkxjz.2014.07.002,http://www.progressingeography.com/CN/abstract/abstract14634.shtml,,1,,,Ch

The temperature variations before and after the mutation and the warming stagnate following the mutation were also discussed. Annual (or seasonal) AMinT mutation happened first on 1977 to 1987. Then the AvT and AMaxT mutation happened on 1978 to 1993 and 1978 to 1994, respectively. The mutation period of average autumn and winter temperature were same as AMaxT. The earliest intra-annual mutation was winter (1977 to 1978), and the latest was summer (1987 to 1994). The winter and AMaxT had more variations than summer and AMinT. The increase ratio or AMinT was 0.231~0.604?/10a which have the most contribution. All the annual (or seasonal) temperatures had a warming stagnate from 1997 to 2007 after the mutation, successively. The stagnate occurred in spring and not stagnate occurred in summer. Mostly annual and seasonal temperature stagnate happened later than the global period which winter firstly, then autumn, the AvT was the last one (on 2007). The AMaxT increase rate was lower in the period of after mutation and before stagnate. However, the decrease rate of AMaxT if faster after stagnate. The AMinT was on the contrary. This indicates that the AMinT was sensitive to temperature increase and the AMaxT was sensitive to the temperature decrease. In seasonal, the spring AMaxT increase rate is higher from mutation to stagnate, and the spring AMinT decrease rate was the fastest after the temperature stagnate which is -0.324?/a.","Xing Huang, Long Ma, Ting-xi Liu, Jing-ru Wang, Dan-hui Liu, Hong-yu Li",2016,China Environmental Science,36,11,3253-3262,,,,http://manu36.magtech.com.cn/Jweb_zghjkx/CN/abstract/abstract14853.shtml,1,,,,Ch

The augmented Dickey-Fuller, the KPSS, and the nonparametric Phillips-Perron tests are in addition applied in the evaluation of the stochastic properties of the series.

The series have no significant stochastic or deterministic trend. The analysis indicates that the mean temperature has moved upward in decadal, small steps since the 1980s.

Yet, multiple sources of evidence show that climate change continues unabated, raising questions about the status of the ?hiatus?. To examine whether the notion of a ?hiatus? is justified by the available data, we first document that there are multiple definitions of the ?hiatus? in the literature, with its presumed onset spanning a decade. For each of these definitions we compare the associated temperature trend against trends of equivalent length in the entire record of modern global warming. The analysis shows that the ?hiatus? trends are encompassed within the overall distribution of observed trends. We next assess the magnitude and significance of all possible trends up to 25 years duration looking backwards from each year over the past 30 years. At every year during the past 30 years, the immediately preceding warming trend was always significant when 17 years (or more) were included in the calculation, alleged ?hiatus? periods notwithstanding. If current definitions of the ?pause? used in the literature are applied to the historical record, then the climate system ?paused? for more than 1/3 of the period during which temperatures rose 0.6?K.","Stephan Lewandowsky, James S.

223,Lempereur et al. 2017,4,1998,13,2016,,,,,,,local,,,Recent climate hiatus revealed dual control by temperature and drought on the stem growth of Mediterranean Quercus ilex,"A better understanding of stem growth phenology and its climate drivers would improve projections of the impact of climate change on forest productivity. Under a Mediterranean climate, tree growth is primarily limited by soil water availability during summer, but cold temperatures in winter also prevent tree growth in evergreen forests. In the widespread Mediterranean evergreen tree species Quercus ilex, the duration of stem growth has been shown to predict annual stem increment, and to be limited by winter temperatures on the one hand, and by the summer drought onset on the other hand. We tested how these climatic controls of Q. ilex growth varied with recent climate change by correlating a 40-year tree ring record and a 30-year annual diameter inventory against winter temperature, spring precipitation, and simulated growth duration. Our results showed that growth duration was the best predictor of annual tree growth. We predicted that recent climate changes have resulted in earlier growth onset (?10 days) due to winter warming and earlier growth cessation (?26 days) due to earlier drought onset. These climatic trends partly offset one another, as we observed no significant trend of change in tree growth between 1968 and 2008. A moving-window correlation analysis revealed that in the past, Q. ilex growth was only correlated with water availability, but that since the 2000s, growth suddenly became correlated with winter temperature in addition to spring drought. This change in the climate?growth correlations matches the start of the recent atmospheric warming pause also known as the ?climate hiatus?. The duration of growth of Q. ilex is thus shortened because winter warming has stopped compensating for increasing drought in the last decade. Decoupled trends in precipitation and temperature, a neglected aspect of climate change, might reduce forest productivity through phenological constraints and have more consequences than climate warming alone.","Morine Lempereur, Jean-Marc Limousin, Fr‚d‚ric Guibal, Jean-Marc Ourcival, Serge Rambal, Julien Ruffault, Florent Mouillot",2017,Global Change Biology,23,1,42-55,25-02-16,10-09-16,10.1111/gcb.13495,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13495/full,,,1,,En

225,Gao et al. 2015,6,2008,13,2014,,,,,,,Cosmic RO tropopause temperature,,,Characteristics of the Trends in the Global Tropopause Estimated From COSMIC Radio Occultation Data,"This paper discusses the variabilities and trends in the global tropopause based on the gridded monthly mean Global Positioning System radio occultation data from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) mission during July 2006-February 2014. We find that the tropopause height can reflect El Ni¤o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The correlation coefficient between global tropopause height anomalies and the Ni¤o 3.4 sea surface temperature index is 0.53, with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.8 at a lag of three months. We present first the detailed investigations about the spatial distribution of trends in tropopause parameters in each 10ø ? 5ø longitude-latitude grid cell over the globe and find that the rates of change in the tropopause parameters during this time period are high in some particular regions such as the Southern Indian Ocean, Antarctica, Western Europe, North Pacific, and the east coast of North America. An analysis of global monthly means of the tropopause parameters indicates a global tropopause height increase of 0.03 ñ 2.36 m/year during 2006-2014, with a corresponding temperature increase of 0.020 ñ 0.008øC/year, and a pressure increase of 0.11 ñ 0.059 hPa/year. The upward trend of tropopause height is significantly weaker than that in the past years, which might be attributed to the expected stratospheric ozone recovery associated with the Montreal Protocol, the global warming slowdown, and the abnormal global climate change in recent years. The trends of the tropopause parameters are the most significant over the Southern Indian Ocean and Antarctica during September/October/November, which could be due to the stratospheric ozone recovery.","P.
